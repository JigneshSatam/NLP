Colliding black holes arent always as evenly matched as scientists expected, according to a cosmic chirp astronomers have puzzled over for a year.On April 12, 2019, gravitational wave detectors picked up a signal of space-time ripples caused by colliding black holes — which in and of itself has gone from groundbreaking to nearly mundane over the past five years. But as scientists studied the detection more closely, they realized that it didnt match the signals they have seen so far.Instead of two evenly matched black holes, the new detection seemed to be triggered by a lopsided merger in which one black hole was three or four times more massive than the other. Scientists affiliated with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) announced the discovery . April 18 at an online meeting of the American Physical Society."Its an unlikely observation," Maya Fishbach, a doctoral candidate at the University of Chicago who presented the new discovery, said during her talk. "Its an exceptional event because we just wouldnt have expected it based on those first 10 binary black holes."Related: Eureka! Scientists photograph a black hole for the 1st time .An artists depiction of mismatched black holes colliding. (Image credit: N. Fischer, H. Pfeiffer, A. Buonanno (Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics), Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes project)Scientists studied those 10 mergers during LIGOs first two observing runs, conducted between 2015 and 2017. Each time, no matter how big the collision, the two black holes involved were about the same size. Then, just weeks into LIGOs third observing run in 2019, the newly reported signal appeared and turned that trend on its head.“We had detected several binary black hole mergers before, but never one where the bigger black hole is nearly four times more massive than its companion," Frank Ohme, a LIGO scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Germany, said in a statement . "It’s clear we are just beginning to understand the diversity of black hole binaries out there, and I am excited to decipher the universes secrets every day a little more."The newly announced discovery involved objects about 2.4 billion light-years away, Fishbach said, with one black hole about eight times the mass of our sun and the other about 30 times the mass of our sun."This is roughly equal to the ratio of filling in a regular Oreo to [that] in a Mega Stuf Oreo," Christopher Berry, a gravitational-wave scientist at Northwestern University, wrote in a blog post . about the detection. (Dont get too excited: "Investigations of connections between Oreos and black hole formation are ongoing," he added.)The detection gives scientists a better understanding of how black holes pair up. "We are learning that systems of this kind exist and how rare they are," Giancarlo Cella, researcher at Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare in Italy and the data analysis coordinator for LIGOs European counterpart Virgo, said in a statement . "This will allow us to deduce how they formed."LIGOs third observing run, which was cut short by the spreading coronavirus pandemic, netted a treasure trove of more than 50 detections, Fishbach said. Scientists are still analyzing those observations, so other unbalanced mergers could be hiding in that data. But even just the one asymmetric merger dramatically reshapes the range of black hole pairs scientists are now prepared to expect."This one event represents a big step forward in our understanding of the population," Fishbach said.The new research is described in a paper . posted on April 18 by the LIGO collaboration but not yet published or peer-reviewed. Why are black holes so weird?

An observation at high significance, meaning the mass difference likely is real. Despite that they see a large in-plane (I think) spin (which was easier than in equal mass mergers) of the larger black hole, they cant reject that it was a merger between pristine black holes. Else the hierarchical merger - the larger black hole already being a merger result - looks interesting! A birth place in a dense cluster with some trinary star systems is a possibility.
.
The mass asymmetry meant odd overtones in the gravity wave spectra, so they could test general relativity theory further than ever before - it still works perfectly well!.

I note this from the space.com article, "The newly announced discovery involved objects about 2.4 billion light-years away, Fishbach said, with one black hole about eight times the mass of our sun and the other about 30 times the mass of our sun. ".
.
However, another report indicates the distance is spread 1.9 to 2.9 billion light-years, LIGO and Virgo detectors catch first gravitational wave from binary black hole merger with unequal masses, "GW190412 was observed by both LIGO detectors and the Virgo detector on 12th of April 2019, early during the detectors third observation run O3. Analyses reveal that the merger happened at a distance of 1.9 to 2.9 billion light-years from Earth. The new unequal mass system is a unique discovery since all binaries observed previously by the LIGO and Virgo detectors consisted of two roughly similar masses. ".

Distance is important when determining masses, etc.
