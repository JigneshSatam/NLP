home news science astronomy massive black hole bends light to magnify distant galaxy by clara moskowitz published july this labeled image of the foreground quasar blue lensing a background galaxy red was taken with the keck ii telescope and its instrument using laser guide star adaptive optics 
discovering more of these lenses will allow astronomers to determine the masses of quasars host galaxies 
a giant black hole spouting energy from inside a galaxy isacting like a cosmic magnifying glass giving astronomers a clear view of an evenmore distant galaxy behind is the first time a quasar 
the central region of agalaxy dominated by an hole 
has been discovered acting as a gravitationallens 
the cosmic lens phenomenon was first predicted by albert einsteins theoryof general discovery gives astronomers a glimpse at two galaxies atonce allowing researchers to photograph the distant object while weighing andmeasuring the intervening galaxy and the bright powerhouse at its quasar is known as sdss and located about from to the theory very large masses warp around them even causing light to bend as it travels through theregion 
thus light from farawayobjects sometimes can be magnified by the bent to provide alarger and brighter 
though also distorted and curved 
this case scientists are more interested in studying thelens itself than the magnified that host quasars are hard to study because theirlight is often overpowered by the blaring radiation from material falling ontothe supermassiveblack holes in their centers 
a single quasar can be times brighterthan an entire galaxy of billion is a bit like staring into bright car headlightsand trying to discern the color of their rims lead researcher fr d riccourbin of the ecole polytechnique f d rale de lausanne in switzerland said ina statement 
by studying the way a quasar magnifies light as a gravitationallens he said we now can measure the masses of these quasar hostgalaxies and overcome this quasarsthe newfound lens and similar ones being sought by researchers could provide an opportunity to learn about the galaxies that shelter quasarsin their studying the way the quasar magnifies the distant light including the shape of its distortion and the number of magnified images thelens produces 
scientists can measure how matter is distributed in the lensgalaxy 
they can even calculate the total matter of the quasar and its quasarsare discovered when their light is being magnified by an intervening galaxyacting as a gravitational lens 
scientists set out to look for a case of thisreverse lensing of a galaxys light by a quasar by looking through the dataobtained by the sloan digital sky survey

download pdf download pdf credit andy pottsin march joseph polchinski began to contemplate suicide at least in mathematical form 
a string theorist at the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara california polchinski was pondering what would happen to an astronaut who dived into a black hole 
obviously he would die 
but how according to the account he wouldn t feel anything special at first even when his fall took him through the black hole s event horizon the invisible boundary beyond which nothing can escape 
but eventually after hours days or even weeks if the black hole was big enough he would begin to notice that gravity was tugging at his feet more strongly than at his head 
as his plunge carried him inexorably downwards the difference in forces would quickly increase and rip him apart before finally crushing his remnants into the black hole s infinitely dense polchinski s calculations carried out with two of his students ahmed almheiri and james sully and fellow string theorist donald marolf at the university of california santa barbara ucsb were telling a different 
in their account quantum effects would turn the event horizon into a seething maelstrom of particles 
anyone who fell into it would hit a wall of fire and be burned to a crisp in an instant 
free interview your browser does not support the audio element 
zeeya merali talks about what would happen if she fell into a black hole the team s verdict published in july shocked the physics community 
such firewalls would violate a foundational tenet of physics that was first articulated almost a century ago by albert einstein who used it as the basis of general relativity his theory of gravity 
known as the equivalence principle it states in part that an observer falling in a gravitational field even the powerful one inside a black hole will see exactly the same phenomena as an observer floating in empty space 
without this principle einstein s framework aware of the implications of their claim polchinski and his offered an alternative plot ending in which a firewall does not form 
but this solution came with a huge price 
physicists would have to sacrifice the other great pillar of their science quantum mechanics the theory governing the interactions between subatomic result has been a flurry of research papers about firewalls all struggling to resolve the impasse none succeeding to everyone s satisfaction 
steve giddings a quantum physicist at the ucsb describes the situation as a crisis in the foundations of physics that may need a revolution to resolve that thought in mind experts came together last month at cern europe s laboratory near geneva switzerland to grapple with the issue face to face 
they hoped to reveal the path towards a unified theory of quantum gravity that brings all the fundamental forces of nature under one umbrella a prize that has eluded physicists for firewall idea shakes the foundations of what most of us believed about black holes said raphael bousso a string theorist at the university of california berkeley as he opened his talk at the meeting 
it essentially pits quantum mechanics against general relativity without giving us any clues as to which direction to go fiery origins the roots of the firewall crisis go back to when physicist stephen hawking at the university of cambridge uk showed that quantum effects cause black holes to run a 
left in isolation the holes will slowly spew out thermal radiation photons and other particles and gradually lose mass until they evaporate away entirely see the information paradox particles aren t the firewall however the subtleties of relativity guarantee that an astronaut falling through the event horizon will not notice this radiation 
but hawking s result was still startling not least because the equations of general relativity say that black holes can only swallow mass and grow not evaporate 
hawking s argument basically comes down to the observation that in the quantum realm empty space isn t empty 
down at this level it is in constant turmoil with pairs of particles and their corresponding antiparticles continually popping into existence before rapidly recombining and vanishing 
only in very delicate laboratory experiments does this submicroscopic frenzy have any observable consequences 
but when a pair appears just outside a black hole s event horizon hawking realized one member could fall in before the two recombined leaving the surviving partner to fly outwards as radiation 
the doomed particle would balance the positive energy of the outgoing particle by carrying negative energy inwards something allowed by quantum rules 
that negative energy would then get subtracted from the black hole s mass causing the hole to s original analysis has since been refined and extended by many researchers and his conclusion is now accepted almost universally 
but with it came the disturbing realization that radiation leads to a paradox that challenges quantum mechanics says that information can not be destroyed 
in principle it should be possible to recover everything there is to know about the objects that fell in a black hole by measuring the quantum state of the radiation coming out 
but hawking showed that it was not that simple the radiation coming out is random 
toss in a kilogram of rock or a kilogram of computer chips and the result will be the same 
watch the black hole even until it dies and there would still be no way to tell how it was formed or what fell in problem dubbed the information paradox divided physicists into two camps 
some like hawking argued that the information truly vanishes when the black hole dies 
if that contradicted quantum laws then better laws needed to be found 
others like john preskill a quantum physicist at the california institute of technology in pasadena stuck by quantum mechanics 
for a time i did seriously try to build an alternative theory that included information loss he says 
but i couldn t find one that made any sense nobody the stalemate continued for the next two decades finding its most famous expression in when preskill publicly bet hawking that information was not being lost with the winner to receive an encyclopaedia of his that same year the deadlock was broken by a discovery made by juan maldacena a physicist then at harvard university in cambridge 
maldacena s insight built on an earlier proposal that any region of our universe can be described by information encoded on its in much the same way that laser light can encode a scene on a hologram 
we used the word hologram as a metaphor says leonard susskind a string theorist at stanford university in california and one of those who came up with the 
but after doing more mathematics it seemed to make literal sense that the universe is a projection of information on the what maldacena came up with was a concrete mathematical of the hologram idea that made use of ideas from superstring theory which posits that elementary particles are composed of tiny vibrating loops of energy 
his model envisages a universe containing strings and black holes that are governed only by gravity bounded by a surface on which elementary particles and fields obey ordinary quantum laws without gravity 
hypothetical residents of the space would never see this boundary because it is infinitely far away 
but that wouldn t matter anything happening in the universe could be described equally well by equations in the universe and vice versa 
i found that there s a mathematical dictionary that allows you to go back and forth between the languages of these two worlds maldacena meant that even evaporation could be described in the world where there is no gravity where quantum laws reign supreme and where information can never be lost 
and if information is preserved there then it must also be preserved in the world 
somehow information must be escaping from the black holes 
one for all a few years later marolf showed that every model of quantum gravity will obey the same rules whether or not it is built from string 
it was a combination of maldacena and marolf s work that turned me around explains a proponent of information loss ted jacobson a quantum physicist at the university of maryland in college park 
in hawking publicly admitted that he had been wrong and gave preskill a baseball encyclopaedia to make good on their was the strength of maldacena s discovery that most physicists believed that the paradox had been settled even though nobody had yet explained how hawking radiation smuggles information out of the black hole 
i guess we just all assumed there would be a straightforward answer says wasn t 
when polchinski and his team set themselves the task of clearing up that loose end in early they soon stumbled on yet another paradox the one that eventually led them to the fatal had shown that the quantum state of any one particle escaping from the black hole is random so the particle can not be carrying any useful information 
but in the susskind and others realized that information could be encoded in the quantum state of the radiation as a whole if the particles could somehow have their states entangled intertwined in such a way that measurements carried out on one will immediately influence its partner no matter how far apart they how could that be wondered the polchinski s team 
for a particle to be emitted at all it has to be entangled with the twin that is sacrificed to the black hole 
and if susskind and others were right it also had to be entangled with all the hawking radiation emitted before it 
yet a rigorous result of quantum mechanics dubbed the monogamy of entanglement says that one quantum system can not be fully entangled with two independent systems at escape this paradox polchinski and his realized one of the entanglement relationships had to be severed 
reluctant to abandon the one required to encode information in the hawking radiation they decided to snip the link binding an escaping hawking particle to its infalling twin 
but there was a cost 
it s a violent process like breaking the bonds of a molecule and it releases energy says polchinski 
the energy generated by severing lots of twins would be enormous 
the event horizon would literally be a ring of fire that burns anyone falling through he says 
and that in turn violates the equivalence principle and its assertion that should feel the same as floating in empty space impossible when the former ends in incineration 
so they posted a paper on the preprint server arxiv presenting physicists with a stark choice either accept that firewalls exist and that general relativity breaks down or accept that information is lost in black holes and quantum mechanics is 
for us firewalls seem like the least crazy option given that choice says paper rocked the physics community 
it was outrageous to claim that giving up einstein s equivalence principle is the best option says jacobson 
bousso agrees adding a firewall simply can t appear in empty space any more than a brick wall can suddenly appear in an empty field and smack you in the if einstein s theory doesn t apply at the event horizon cosmologists would have to question whether it fully applies admits that he thought they could have made a silly mistake 
so he turned to susskind one of the fathers of holography to find it 
my first reaction was that they were wrong says susskind 
he posted a paper stating as before quickly retracting it after further thought 
my second reaction was that they were right my third was that they were wrong again my fourth was that they were right he laughs 
it s earned me the nickname the but my reaction is pretty much the same as most physicists since then more than papers have been posted on the topic in arxiv but as yet nobody has found a flaw in the team s logic 
it s a really beautiful argument proving that there s something inconsistent in our thinking about black holes says don page a collaborator of hawking s during the who is now at the university of alberta in edmonton canada 
a number of inventive solutions have been offered however 
implications one of the most promising resolutions according to susskind has come from daniel harlow a quantum physicist at princeton university in new jersey and patrick hayden a computer scientist at mcgill university in montreal canada 
they considered whether an astronaut could ever detect the paradox with a measurement 
to do so he or she would first have to decode a significant portion of the outgoing hawking radiation then dive into the black hole to examine the infalling particles 
the pair s calculations show that the radiation is so tough to decode that the black hole would evaporate before the astronaut was ready to jump 
there s no fundamental law preventing someone from measuring the paradox says harlow 
but in practice it s giddings however argues that the firewall paradox requires a radical solution 
he has calculated that if the entanglement between the outgoing hawking radiation and its infalling twin is not broken until the escaping particle has travelled a short distance away from the event horizon then the energy released would be much less ferocious and no firewall would be 
this protects the equivalence principle but requires some quantum laws to be modified 
at the cern meeting participants were tantalized by the possibility that giddings model could be tested it predicts that when two black holes merge they may produce distinctive ripples in that can be detected by observatories on earth 
there is another option that would save the equivalence principle but it is so controversial that few dare to champion it maybe hawking was right all those years ago and information is lost in black holes 
ironically it is preskill the man who bet against hawking s claim who raised this alternative at a workshop on firewalls at stanford at the end of last year 
it s surprising that people are not seriously thinking about this possibility because it doesn t seem any crazier than firewalls he says although he adds that his instinct is still that information reluctance to revisit hawking s old argument is a sign of the immense respect that physicists have for maldacena s dictionary relating gravity to quantum theory which seemingly proved that information can not be lost 
this is the deepest ever insight into gravity because it links it to quantum fields says polchinski who compares maldacena s result which has now accumulated close to citations to the discovery that a single theory connects light electricity and magnetism 
if the firewall argument had been made in the early i think it would have been a powerful argument for information loss says bousso 
but now nobody wants to entertain the possibility that maldacena is maldacena is flattered that most physicists would back him in a fight against einstein although he believes it won t come to that 
to completely understand the firewall paradox we may need to flesh out that dictionary he says but we won t need to throw it the only consensus so far is that this problem will not go away any time soon 
during his talk polchinski fielded all proposed strategies for mitigating the firewall carefully highlighting what he sees as their weaknesses 
i m sorry that no one has gotten rid of the firewall he concludes

this is the first photo of the milky ways monster black hole sagittarius a by keith cooper last updated may say hello to sagittarius a 
the event horizon telescope has captured a historic first image of the supermassive black hole at the center of our image which was taken in the light of submillimeter radio waves confirms that there is a black hole in the heart of the milky way that is feeding on a trickle of hydrogen now we didnt have the direct picture to prove that this gentle giant in the center of our galaxy is a black hole feryal özel an astrophysicist at the university of arizona said during a national science foundation news conference held thursday may 
it shows a bright ring surrounding the darkness and the telltale sign of the shadow of the black heres how scientists turned the world into a telescope to see a black hole an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way a behemoth dubbed sagittarius a revealed by the event horizon telescope on may 
image credit event horizon telescope collaboration this is an astounding achievement ryan hickox an astrophysicist at dartmouth college who is not a member of the eht team told 
i think i speak for a large number of my astronomy colleagues when i say how remarkably grateful we the event horizon telescope eht made headlines when it succeeded in producing the first ever image of the event horizon of a black hole specifically the black hole at the center of the active elliptical galaxy messier 
at the same time as it gathered the data that became that image the eht also performed observations of sagittarius a which is the name given to the milky ways supermassive black hole 
however producing an image of sagittarius a proved more difficult than for one thing earths atmosphere can absorb the submillimeter radio waves that the eht relies on 
moreover gas and dust in the intervening between us and sagittarius a can scatter the submillimeter waves and blur the image 
lastly whereas black hole has a voracious appetite and appears bright because it is consuming a lot of gas the flow of material onto sagittarius a is far more feeble meaning it is much to this image wasnt an easy journey özel said 
it took several years to refine the image and confirm what he holes are the densest objects in the universe and their gravity is irresistible to the extent that within a certain distance of a black hole not even light can escape 
scientists call this point of no return the event eht is able to see light in the form of radio waves from hot gas swirling around the edge of the event horizon 
the black hole feeds from the material within its immediate environment whether gas clouds asteroids or even stars that might wander too close and be ripped apart by gravitational tides 
however sagittarius a is being only see a trickle of material making it all the way to the black hole harvard astrophysicist michael johnson said during the nsf press conference 
in human terms it would be like eating just one grain of rice every million the accretion of gas onto sagittarius a is so slow has been a puzzle for many years nobel prize laureate andrea ghez an astrophysicist at the university of california los angeles told 
theres a lot of mysteries associated with the accretion flow in terms of why it is so faint she added 
a collage shows the first image of the black hole at the center of the milky way at its location on the sky 
image credit francisco salgado eht collaboration ghez shared the nobel prize in physics for measuring the mass of sagittarius a by observing the motions of stars orbiting close to it 
ghez and her team calculated a mass that was million times the mass of our sun 
since the size of the event horizon is connected to the mass of the black hole it was therefore possible to make a prediction ghez said 
the power of imaging the black holes ring is that if you know the mass and distance to the black hole in other words the size of the event horizon then you can use that to compare to new image shows that the size of sagittarius a s event horizon is microarcseconds on the image is in very close agreement with theoretical predictions said özel who described it as the biggest test of einsteins theory of general relativity ever made noting that the theory passed with flying a great laboratory for trying to understand how gravity works in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole ghez comparison of event horizon telescope views of the black holes at the center of the galaxy on the left and of the one in the milky way at right 
image credit eht collaboration more uncertain are our explanations for the turbulence seen in the gas ring 
the black hole of is much larger than sagittarius a and therefore it takes days for changes to become apparent whereas sagittarius a is much smaller and as material whips around it the brightness of the ring can change in mere is teeming with activity always gurgling with turbulent energy johnson said of the ring around the event try to explain what they were seeing the eht team which is made up of more than researchers across institutions performed more than million supercomputer simulations to try and find one that was a match for what they observed 
we were left with only a handful of simulations that share the features that we observe but none of them explain all the features johnson said 
in particular the simulations all predicted more and faster variability than what was actually seen and could relate to how gas is accreting onto the ring or how magnetic fields are interacting with that to the image hickox said that its just remarkable to see an image of the black hole that we know best and to see the ring and measure the shadow size as accurately as they this image of sagittarius a can now act as a template for other quiescent black holes in the black hole is more typical of the overall set of black holes in the universe than the one in hickox said 
if you were just to take a picture of a random supermassive black hole in a galaxy somewhere in the universe then this is what it would look image of sagittarius a and of the black hole in before it has been made possible through the magic of a technique known as very long baseline interferometry which allows astronomers to combine data from radio telescopes all across the world as though they were one large telescope effectively making the eht the largest telescope on earth 
at the time when the observations were made the network consisted of eight telescopes including one the south polar telescope that was too far south to study although three more have since been added to the network 
the configuration means that the ehts maximum baseline which is equivalent to a telescopes aperture for observing sagittarius a was miles kilometers observations will now focus on getting sharper images to better understand the physics of turbulence in the ring around the black hole as well as how the black hole affects the environment of the galaxy around is driving us to make even better measurements and sharper images johnson a and the black hole in were the ehts top two targets because of their relatively large angular size on the sky 
supermassive black holes in other galaxies appear far smaller on the sky beyond even the abilities of the eht to image their event horizon 
to be able to do so would require a lengthening of the baseline that is to widen the ehts aperture between the two widest points in the ehts network 
in this sense the resolution that the eht can achieve is limited by the size of earth but hickox says there are possibilities beyond heard talk about potentially having a addition to the eht which would significantly increase the overall angular resolution he told 
that would be an exciting step note this story was updated at and

here s how it works 
home news science astronomy black holes may have existed since the beginning of time and could explain dark matter mystery by tereza pultarova published december primordial black holes could explain more than one astronomical mystery 
a visualization of two black holes merging 
hurt ipac the nature and origin of black holes and their role in the evolution of the universe still puzzles scientists 
now a new study suggests that the existence of black holes from the earliest moments of the universe could explain more than one astronomical mystery 
the new study suggests that small primordial black holes filled the early universe right after the big bang acting as an accelerator of star and galaxy formation 
this theory by itself is not new as it was proposed by stephen hawking in 
in the new study however a team of astronomers shows how the existence of such primordial black holes neatly fills some major gaps in the current understanding of the universe 
first these black holes could explain the existence and nature of dark matter the invisible stuff that according to estimates makes up some of all matter in the universe 
how do they do that 
simply these black holes could themselves be that never before observed dark matter the evidence for which has so far failed to materialize despite the fact that the universe as we understand it can not exist without astronomers peer deeper into milky ways heart than ever before in new imagesour study shows that without introducing new particles or new physics we can solve mysteries of modern cosmology from the nature of dark matter itself to the origin of supermassive black holes nico cappelluti assistant professor in physics at the university of miami and of the new study said in a theory of primordial black holes originally proposed by hawking was later abandoned for the current dominant view of black holes being born after massive stars collapse at the end of their lives 
but observations and detections of black holes enabled in the past years with sophisticated technology show that the black holes lurking around in the universe dont always match expectations 
some black holes seem too big others too small for what would be possible if they had all formed just from collapsing massive stars 
black holes of different sizes are still a mystery günther hasinger science director at the european space agency esa and also a of the paper said in the statement 
we dont understand how supermassive black holes could have grown so huge in the relatively short time available since the universe to the theory black holes existed from the beginning of time accelerating star formation in the early millions of years after the big bang 
image credit esa the new model proposed by the scientists changes a few points on the assumed timeline of the universes evolution 
for example if primordial black holes existed from the beginning of time they would start merging faster allowing themselves plenty of time to grow into the sizes that can be detected today 
the gravity of these black holes would also speed up the formation of first stars and galaxies as it would lead to a faster collapse of the dust and gas clouds that filled the dark universe in the first millions of years after the big bang 
as a result those mysterious dark ages would be shorter and the first stars would form much black holes if they do exist could well be the seeds from which all black holes form including the one at the center of the milky way priyamvada natarajan a professor of astronomy at yale university and a of the study said in the statement 
and its not just the big black holes which are hard to explain 
esas gaia mission which creates the most detailed map of our galaxy the milky way has produced evidence of a large number of smaller black holes scattered all over the galaxy that are too small to be born from the death of giant stars 
related content where do black holes lead scientists revisit the black hole they ever discovered and realize its bigger than they first image of a black hole gets a polarizing update that sheds light on magnetic fields scientists might soon find out whether their theory is correct 
the james webb space telescope the biggest and most complex astronomical observatory ever built is just being readied for launch 
liftoff is currently targeted for no earlier than most important goal of this mission is to detect the first light in the universe that of those first stars that formed after the big bang 
and when exactly that happened will show which theory is more correct that black holes existed since the beginning of time or that they only started forming after the first generation of stars died the first stars and galaxies already formed in the dark ages webb should be able to see evidence of them hasinger new study has been accepted for publication in the astrophysical journal and is available online on the preprint site arxiv

home references science astronomy what happens at the center of a black hole 
by paul sutter last updated february all of the possibilities are very weird 
artists illustration of a black hole 
image credit shutterstock jump to planck stars gravastars lets go for a spin additional resources paul sutter is an astrophysicist at suny stony brook and the flatiron institute host of ask a spaceman and space radio and author of how to die in space 
sutter contributed this article to expert voices singularity at the center of a black hole is the ultimate no mans land a place where matter is compressed down to an infinitely tiny point and all conceptions of time and space completely break down 
and it doesnt really exist 
something has to replace the singularity but were not exactly sure what 
lets explore some black holes of the universe images planck starsit could be that deep inside a black hole matter doesnt get squished down to an infinitely tiny point 
instead there could be a smallest possible configuration of matter the tiniest possible pocket of is called a planck star and its a theoretical possibility envisioned by loop quantum gravity which is itself a highly hypothetical proposal for creating a quantum version of gravity 
in the world of loop quantum gravity space and time are quantized the universe around us is composed of tiny discrete chunks but at such an incredibly tiny scale that our movements appear smooth and theoretical chunkiness of provides two benefits 
one it takes the dream of quantum mechanics to its ultimate conclusion explaining gravity in a natural way 
and two it makes it impossible for singularities to form inside black matter squishes down under the immense gravitational weight of a collapsing star it meets resistance 
the discreteness of prevents matter from reaching anything smaller than the planck length around times meters 
all the material that has ever fallen into the black hole gets compressed into a ball not much bigger than this 
perfectly microscopic but definitely not infinitely resistance to continued compression eventually forces the material to explode making black holes only temporary objects 
but because of the extreme time dilation effects around black holes from our perspective in the outside universe it takes billions even trillions of years before they go boom 
so were all set for what is gravity gravastarsanother attempt to eradicate the singularity one that doesnt rely on untested theories of quantum gravity is known as the gravastar 
its such a theoretical concept that my spell checker didnt even recognize the word 
the difference between a black hole and a gravastar is that instead of a singularity the gravastar is filled with dark energy 
dark energy is a substance that permeates causing it to expand outward 
it sounds like but its real dark energy is currently in operation in the larger cosmos causing our entire universe to accelerate in its matter falls onto a gravastar it isnt able to actually penetrate the event horizon due to all that dark energy on the inside and therefore just hangs out on the surface 
but outside that surface gravastars look and act like normal black holes 
a black holes event horizon is its point of no return the boundary beyond which nothing not even light can escape 
however recent observations of merging black holes with gravitational wave detectors have potentially ruled out the existence of gravastars because merging gravastars will give a different signal than merging black holes and outfits like ligo the laser interferometer observatory and virgo are getting more and more examples by the day 
while gravastars arent exactly a in our universe they are definitely on thin universe big bang to now in easy stepsrelated stories what are black holes 
facts theories and definition einsteins theory of general relativity the hunt for wormholes how scientists look for tunnelslets go for a spinplanck stars and gravastars may have awesome names but the reality of their existence is in doubt 
so maybe theres a more mundane explanation for singularities one thats based on a more nuanced and realistic view of black holes in our idea of a single point of infinite density comes from our conception of stationary uncharged rather boring black holes 
real black holes are much more interesting characters especially when they spin of a rotating black hole stretches the singularity into a ring 
and according to the math of einsteins theory of general relativity which is the only math weve got once you pass through the ring singularity you enter a wormhole and pop out through a white hole the polar opposite of a black hole where nothing can enter and matter rushes out at the speed of light into an entirely new and exciting patch of the challenge the interiors of rotating black holes are catastrophically unstable 
and this is according to the very same math that leads to the prediction of the problem with rotating black holes is that well they rotate 
the singularity stretched into a ring is rotating at such a fantastic pace that it has incredible centrifugal force 
and in general relativity strong enough centrifugal forces act like antigravity they push not creates a boundary inside the black hole called the inner horizon 
outside this region radiation is falling inward toward the singularity compelled by the extreme gravitational pull 
but radiation is pushed by the antigravity near the ring singularity and the turning point is the inner horizon 
if you were to encounter the inner horizon you would face a wall of infinitely energetic radiation the entire past history of the universe blasted into your face in less than a blink of an formation of an inner horizon sows the seeds for the destruction of the black hole 
but rotating black holes certainly exist in our universe so that tells us that our math is wrong and something funky is going really happening inside a black hole 
we dont know and the scary part is that we may never resourcesyou can learn more about black holes at this nasa explainer page 
this bbc earth piece has good basic information about black holes as well and it also describes what would happen to you if you fell into one of these monsters

home news science astronomy black holes may be the source of mysterious dark energy by stefanie waldek published february the origin of dark energy has been perplexing scientists for decades 
comments an illustration of a black hole 
image credit mark photo images when astronomers discovered that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate they theorized that some force must be pushing things farther apart and overcoming gravity which should be slowing things down 
that force was suggested to be dark energy but no one has ever figured out from where it a team of international researchers led by the university of hawaii has discovered the first evidence for the origin point of dark energy black holes acquire mass in two ways accretion of gas and mergers with other black holes 
but in studying nine billion years of black hole evolution in dormant giant elliptical galaxies the researchers discovered that the older black holes are much larger than they should be based on those two methods of growth 
that means there must be another way these black holes are acquiring mass 
researchers suggest the answer is dark energy in the form of vacuum energy a kind of energy included in spacetime itself that pushes the universe further apart accelerating the expansion according to a statement black holes everything you need to knowif the theory holds then this is going to revolutionize the whole of cosmology because at last weve got a solution for the origin of dark energy thats been perplexing cosmologists and theoretical physicists for more than years chris pearson of stfc ral space a of a study on the discovery said in a stories galactic collisions act as a cosmic delivery service for hungry monster black holes star survives spaghettification by black hole black holes at galactic centers blast out times more light than previously thoughtthe idea that black holes are a source of dark energy isnt new 
in fact its part of einsteins theory of general relativity 
but this is the first time astronomers have obtained observational evidence to support the really saying two things at once that theres evidence the typical black hole solutions dont work for you on a long long timescale and we have the first proposed astrophysical source for dark energy said study author duncan farrah university of hawaii astronomer in the paper on the teams research was published in the astrophysical journal letters on wednesday feb stefanie waldek on twitter stefaniewaldek

see all comments comments comment from the forums murgatroyd the explainer video in the article explained exactly nothing 
reply pentcho valev is the space inside say a galaxy growing but overcome by the gravitational attraction between the stars 
the answer is no 
space within any gravitationally bound system is unaffected by the surrounding expansion 
https sabine hossenfelder the solution of general relativity that describes the expanding universe is a solution on average it is good only on very large distances 
but the solutions that describe galaxies are different and just dont expand 
its not that galaxies expand unnoticeably they just dont 
the full solution then is both stitched together expanding space between galaxies it is only somewhere beyond the scales of galaxy clusters that expansion takes over 
http so cosmologists apply the expansion solutions only to voids deprived of galaxies to galaxies and galactic clusters they apply nonexpansion solutions 
why do cosmologists resort to this trick 
because if they applied expansion solutions to galaxies and galactic clusters observations would immediately disprove the expansion theory 
here is why if expansion is actual inside galaxies and galactic clusters the competition between expansion and gravitational attraction would distort those cosmic structures 
fringes only weakly bound by gravity would succumb to expansion and fly away 
and the theory if it takes into account the intragalactic expansion will have to predict the distortions 
but no distortions are observed there is really no expansion inside galaxies and galactic clusters 
and cosmologists without much publicity have simply made the theory consistent with this fact 
since there is no expansion inside galaxies and galactic clusters there is no expansion anywhere else 
the so called cosmological hubble redshift is due to the speed of light slowing down as photons travel through vacuum in a universe 
this is not a totally unacceptable idea some physicists however suggest that there might be one other cosmic factor that could influence the speed of light quantum vacuum fluctuation 
this theory holds that empty spaces in the universe arent actually empty theyre teeming with particles that are just constantly changing from existent to states 
quantum fluctuations therefore could slow down the speed of light 
https reply pertan black holes are the transformers of the universe 
works like vacuum cleaners 
it is a null energy 
they balance the universal energy 
what goes in generally negative energy and turns back into universe as positive energy 
if the negative energy is stubborn to be transformed it can stay in there as in an infinite loop 
can be called lost in space but it is a one way ticket 
because inside is null energy and vacuums the negative you can not call it dark energy 
it works for all positive 
reply lara or we dont understand gravity and for that reason and others dont know how far away things really are and all of this is just nonsense reply vulvox admin said black holes may be the origin of dark energy according to a study by a team of researchers led by the university of hawaii 
black holes may be the source of mysterious dark energy read morei dont understand how black holes would cause repulsion instead of pulling the universe closer together 
reply declantraill the new theory that preceded this new observation i would like to bring to your attention my paper on researchgate in about my idea that dark matter is actually caused by black holes 
the idea is that black holes consume the vacuum energy which has the effect of drawing inwards all embedded matter stars planets etc in the space surrounding the black holes 
thus an apparent extra inward acceleration which is constant with distance is produced and can explain galaxy rotation rates 
it also explains other phenomena such as the apparent lopsided halos of dark matter that seem to exist 
you can read about why this occurs and other details in my paper here an explanation for galaxy rotation rates without requiring dark matter https regards declan traill bsc melb reply view all comments show more comments more from space new rocket aborts launch galactic carrier plane flies for time since mystery objects shot down by us likely werent spy craft biden holes may be the source of mysterious dark from space

home news science astronomy explosion from the early universe illuminates secret black hole by chelsea gohd last updated april this artistic impression illustrates a new black hole that was discovered through gravitational lensing using light from an ancient cosmic explosion 
image credit carl knox ozgrav light coming from an explosion in the early universe has illuminated a black hole that astronomers think could expand their understanding of how the celestial objects form 
three billion years ago a burst known as grb exploded out into the universe 
in astronomers observed the event essentially peering back in time with the batse burst and transient source experiment astrophysics experiment on the compton observatory which was launched in on the space shuttle atlantis 
now astronomers used the light coming from the ancient explosion to detect an black hole imbh which are elusive and challenging to spot 
the light coming from the burst allowed the team to use a phenomenon called gravitational lensing to find an imbh 
this finding supports the existence of imbhs as they are so hard to detect that some scientists question whether or not theyre even real 
this work also sheds light on how different types of black holes might form and how supermassive black holes smbh could get so massive 
related no escape dive into a black hole infographic black holes are just what they sound like celestial middleweights 
the objects are fairly massive larger than stellar black holes sbh but not as massive as smbh perhaps clocking in at between and times the mass of our sun 
however these midsize black holes are especially challenging to detect because they are smaller and less active than supermassive black holes they do not have readily available sources of fuel nor as strong a gravitational pull to draw stars and other cosmic material which would produce telltale glows according to nasa 
if a black hole is not accreting matter it is quite difficult to detect as by name and nature they are black james paynter an astrophysicist at the university of melbourne in australia who led this research told 
only the effects of their gravity can betray the existence of a quiescent black while imbhs might not be easily spotted by luminous emissions like a supermassive black hole would scientists in this new study were able to use gravitational lensing to do the trick 
gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when an object like a black hole acts like a lens distorting the light coming from a faraway light source like a cosmic explosion 
this distortion signals astronomers that there must be a massive object in the way 
to go a step further and determine what type of object is causing this lensing the team had to determine its mass 
because the objects mass falls within the range of an imbh they decided it was the most likely possibility 
they were also able to weed out contenders like globular clusters for not being dense enough and dark matter haloes for not being compact enough to cause gravitational discovering the imbh using this technique it tells us something about how common they imbh are rachel webster an astronomer at the university of melbourne and of this study told 
if they were very very rare then we would be most unlikely to see even one case of gravitational lensing 
its all about statistics and imbh detection could also reveal information about their larger cousins smbh 
it is important to discover these objects to fill the observational gap between stellar black holes sbh and smbh paynter said 
currently we do not know how smbh are able to grow to such huge masses within the age of the universe 
there is simply not enough stuff for them to accrete nor enough clue to the smbh puzzle may lie in imbhs scientists hope 
if a seed population of imbhs exist it begins to fill in this gap 
where the imbhs came from is another they may be formed from the of massive stars in the early universe or they may be older primordial black holes formed during the very first phases of the universe paynter added 
while this work is a step forward in not only proving the existence of imbh but in exploring how different types of black holes develop and exist out in the cosmos there is still much to be explored and learned about this imbh 
we now dont know if this imbh is wandering the cosmos alone or if it is bound to a galaxy or cluster of stars 
so while we are able to estimate the prevalence of these objects in the universe we cant pinpoint them to a location or specific habitat paynter said

home news science astronomy gravitational waves point scientists to elusive black hole by meghan bartels published september astrophysicists are super excited about a new bang 
comments a new sound has joined the symphony of the universe as we hear astrophysicists have been using detectors to hear signals and decode massive collisions that send subtle ripples across spacetime 
now scientists have heard a new kind of sound a fast deep bang that could unlock even more cosmic secrets according to new research from the laser interferometer observatory ligo and its european counterpart is another first gabriela gonzalez a physicist at louisiana state university and a member of the massive team behind the new research told 
we never get tired of more than a year studying the strange new signal dubbed scientists think they know what caused it the largest merger seen to date resulting in a hitherto unseen black gravitational waves the ligo laser interferometer project in photosan artists depiction of two colliding black holes 
image credit mark myers arc centre of excellence for gravitational wave discovery ozgrav a thunderclap across the universewhile scientists took their time on the analysis the signal stood out right away as something unique 
zsuzsanna marka vividly remembers may the night detectors picked up the signal 
marka is one of the few dozen astrophysicists who have connected their phones to the cosmos and receive alerts whenever detectors hear a possible signal out in the an event happens at night i wake up marka a on the new research and an astronomer at columbia university told 
she receives the alerts so that she can check whether such events are accompanied by a burst of tiny particles called neutrinos 
but as she worked that night in the back of her mind she already knew it was a special could not help but noticing the high mass marka said 
she remembers thinking this is awesome 
this is really one of the incredibly events which we were hoping we would see but it wasnt clear that actually those black holes holes come in different sizes stellar black holes which are to times the mass of our sun according to nasa and supermassive black holes millions or more times larger the behemoths that lurk at the heart of galaxies like the milky way 
but astronomers have suspected that there might be something in between black holes that clock in at something like to times the mass of the sun according to artists depiction of the colliding black holes detected on may and their end product 
hurt ipac an black hole cant form the way most small black holes do from the explosions of dying stars 
stars always lose material during this process but after a star reaches a certain size no matter how much larger it grows when it explodes it will result in a black hole with about times the mass of our sun 
larger exploding stars simply throw away more material ending up with black holes at that same maximum size according to until now these theorized objects have been elusive even by the already mysterious standards of black holes 
while scientists have begun to observe stellar black holes from ligos earlier detections and supermassive black holes from the event horizon telescopes image of the object at the heart of galaxy the same has not been true for black new bang represents the first observational evidence for this class of object since calculations suggest the signal was created when an black hole with times the mass of our sun collided with a stellar black hole of times the suns once again surprises us not just with the detection of black holes in sizes that are difficult to explain but doing it using techniques that were not designed specifically for stellar mergers pedro marronetti program director for gravitational physics at the national science foundation which funds the ligo detectors said in a is of tremendous importance since it showcases the instruments ability to detect signals from completely unforeseen astrophysical events marronetti said 
ligo shows that it can also observe the diagram shows and collisions detected to date 
is located at the center top and produced the most massive black hole of all of them 
image credit elavsky aaron geller a new generation of black holes or something more exotic as usual when it comes to gravitational waves scientists have to build their hypotheses around the scant information they can decipher from an the case of the gravitational wave candidate the signal was much briefer than ligos previous detections have been lasting just one tenth of a second 
it was also a much lower frequency than the signals produced by previous black hole mergers 
scientists could also trace the signal to a particular swath of that information astrophysicists can calculate the distance at which a collision occurs about billion away in this case 
scientists can also calculate the sizes of the two objects that collided in this case and times the mass of our sun and of the resulting object about times the mass of the sun 
during a collision some mass is lost as the energy of gravitational waves 
because of the size limit on black holes born from dying stars the starting masses suggest that at least the larger black hole and perhaps the smaller as well could itself be the result of a collision between two black black holes merge form a new black hole then they merge again marka said 
this can only happen if you have a very dense environment where you have a lot of black numerical model showing the black hole collision detected on may 
image credit fischer pfeiffer buonanno max planck institute for gravitational physics simulating extreme spacetimes sxs collaboration she hopes that the collision occurred near an active galactic nucleus a massive temperamental object at the center of a galaxy that thanks to its powerful gravity can anchor other objects nearby although theres no way for scientists to be sure whether thats the story behind given the data they have about spotting more merging black holes could solve an ongoing puzzle about their larger cousins supermassive black holes the origins of which scientists cant are the elephants in the room christopher berry an astrophysicist at northwestern university and a ligo researcher said in a second statement 
do they grow from black holes which are born when a star collapses or are they born via an undiscovered means 
long have we searched for an black hole to bridge the gap between and supermassive black holes 
now we have proof that black holes do scientists excitement about the signal and the possibility they saw an black hole they cant be positive their current hypothesis is correct 
although the merger of two black holes fits the data best astrophysicists are contemplating more exotic explanations as if something entirely new produced these gravitational waves 
vicky kalogera another ligo specialist at northwestern university said in the same statement 
its a tantalizing prospect 
she added that current hypotheses for the signals cause include the collapse of a milky way star or an ancient cosmic waves ripple out from the merger of two black holes 
image credit deborah ferguson karan jani deirdre shoemaker pablo laguna georgia tech maya collaboration after the firstright now the ligo and virgo detectors are offline forced to close at the end of march by the coronavirus pandemic still ravaging the globe 
but astrophysicists are planning to upgrade the detectors and their algorithms then get back to listening to the types of upgrades will be crucial for detecting more signals like 
making the detectors themselves more sensitive will allow scientists to capture ever more distant signals and the algorithms that process the data will allow scientists to identify briefer signals like this one more seeing what appears to be the collision of two black holes that were themselves formed by mergers bodes well for the number of signals overall that are out there to observe gonzalez am hoping it means that there are a lot more black holes it might be that these are clusters of black holes that because they are clustered together then they merge more often she said 
i am hoping that these clusters are large and they are in lots and lots of places so we can see more black she and her colleagues will have to see what future observations does what it does we can not tell nature what to do gonzalez said 
we take the data and make the discoveries and let theoretical astrophysicists speculate about and invent new theories about what could produce these large black research is described in two papers published today in the journals physical review letters and the astrophysical journal meghan bartels at mbartels or follow her on twitter meghanbartels

not only does the black hole candidate reside in the constellation monoceros the unicorn its incredibly low mass about three times that of the sun makes it nearly one of a how many black holes are there in the universe black hole images the event horizon telescope a array of eight radio telescopes forged through international collaboration captured this image of the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy and its shadow 
image credit eht collaboration in the event horizon telescope eht collaboration released the first image ever recorded of a black hole 
the eht saw the black hole in the center of galaxy while the telescope was examining the event horizon or the area past which nothing can escape from a black hole 
the image maps the sudden loss of photons particles of light 
it also opens up a whole new area of research in black holes now that astronomers know what a black hole looks astronomers revealed a new view of the giant black hole at the center of showing what the colossal structure looks like in polarized light 
as polarized light waves have a different orientation and brightness compared to unpolarized light the new image shows the black hole in even more detail 
polarization is a signature of magnetic fields and the image makes it clear that the black holes ring is magnetized 
following the release of the first image of a black hole in astronomers captured a new polarized view of the black hole 
image credit eht collaboration what do black holes look like 
black holes have three layers the outer and inner event horizon and the event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the mouth of the black hole past which light can not escape 
once a particle crosses the event horizon it can not leave 
gravity is constant across the event inner region of a black hole where the objects mass lies is known as its singularity the single point in where the mass of the black hole is cant see black holes the way they can see stars and other objects in space 
instead astronomers must rely on detecting the radiation black holes emit as dust and gas are drawn into the dense creatures 
but supermassive black holes lying in the center of a galaxy may become shrouded by the thick dust and gas around them which can block the telltale stories what happens at the center of a black hole where do black holes lead to what is the biggest thing in the universe 
sometimes as matter is drawn toward a black hole it ricochets off the event horizon and is hurled outward rather than being tugged into the maw 
bright jets of material traveling at speeds are created 
although the black hole remains unseen these powerful jets can be viewed from great ehts image of a black hole in released in was an extraordinary effort requiring two years of research even after the images were taken 
thats because the collaboration of telescopes which stretches across many observatories worldwide produces an astounding amount of data that is too large to transfer via the internet 
with time researchers expect to image other black holes and build up a repository of what the objects look like 
the next target is likely sagittarius a which is the black hole in the center of our own milky way galaxy 
sagittarius a is intriguing because it is quieter than expected which may be due to magnetic fields smothering its activity a study reported 
another study that year showed that a cool gas halo surrounds sagittarius a which gives unprecedented insight into what the environment around a black hole looks black hole anatomy diagram shows what a black hole looks like and labels the different components 
image credit eso types of black holes so far astronomers have identified three types of black holes stellar black holes supermassive black holes and intermediate black holes 
stellar black holes small but deadly when a star burns through the last of its fuel the object may collapse or fall into itself 
for smaller stars those up to about three times the suns mass the new core will become a neutron star or a white dwarf 
but when a larger star collapses it continues to compress and creates a stellar black holes formed by the collapse of individual stars are relatively small but incredibly dense 
one of these objects packs more than three times the mass of the sun into the diameter of a city 
this leads to a crazy amount of gravitational force pulling on objects around the object 
stellar black holes then consume the dust and gas from their surrounding galaxies which keeps them growing in black holes the birth of giants small black holes populate the universe but their cousins supermassive black holes dominate 
these enormous black holes are millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun but are about the same size in diameter 
such black holes are thought to lie at the center of pretty much every galaxy including the milky arent certain how such large black holes spawn 
once these giants have formed they gather mass from the dust and gas around them material that is plentiful in the center of galaxies allowing them to grow to even more enormous black holes may be the result of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes that merge 
large gas clouds could also be responsible collapsing together and rapidly accreting mass 
a third option is the collapse of a stellar cluster a group of stars all falling together 
fourth supermassive black holes could arise from large clusters of dark matter 
this is a substance that we can observe through its gravitational effect on other objects however we dont know what dark matter is composed of because it does not emit light and can not be directly black holes scientists once thought that black holes came in only small and large sizes but research has revealed the possibility that midsize or intermediate black holes imbhs could exist 
such bodies could form when stars in a cluster collide in a chain reaction 
several of these imbhs forming in the same region could then eventually fall together in the center of a galaxy and create a supermassive black astronomers found what appeared to be an black hole in the arm of a spiral galaxy 
and in astronomers took advantage of an ancient burst to detect have been looking very hard for these black holes study tim roberts of the university of durham in the united kingdom said in a statement 
there have been hints that they exist but imbhs have been acting like a relative that isnt interested in being from suggested that these imbhs may exist in the heart of dwarf galaxies or very small galaxies 
observations of such galaxies five of which were previously unknown to science before this latest survey revealed activity common in black holes suggesting the presence of black holes of from to solar masses 
the information came from the sloan digital sky survey which examines about million galaxies and can detect the kind of light often observed coming from black holes that are picking up nearby debris 
binary black holes double trouble artists illustration of a supermassive black hole with a companion black hole orbiting around it 
image credit in astronomers using the laser interferometer observatory ligo detected gravitational waves from merging stellar black have further confirmation of the existence of black holes that are larger than solar masses these are objects we didnt know existed before ligo detected them david shoemaker the spokesperson for the ligo scientific collaboration lsc said in a statement 
ligos observations also provide insights into the direction a black hole spins 
as two black holes spiral around one another they can spin in the same direction or the opposite are two theories on how binary black holes form 
the first suggests that the two black holes in a binary form at about the same time from two stars that were born together and died explosively at about the same time 
the companion stars would have had the same spin orientation as one another so the two black holes left behind would as the second model black holes in a stellar cluster sink to the center of the cluster and pair up 
these companions would have random spin orientations compared to one another according to ligo scientific collaboration 
ligos observations of companion black holes with different spin orientations provide stronger evidence for this formation starting to gather real statistics on binary black hole systems said ligo scientist keita kawabe of caltech who is based at the ligo hanford observatory 
thats interesting because some models of black hole binary formation are somewhat favored over the others even now and in the future we can further narrow this hole factsif you fell into a black hole theory has long suggested that gravity would stretch you out like spaghetti though your death would come before you reached the singularity 
but a study published in the journal nature suggested that quantum effects would cause the event horizon to act much like a wall of fire which would instantly burn you to holes dont suck 
suction is caused by pulling something into a vacuum which the massive black hole definitely is not 
instead objects fall into them just as they fall toward anything that exerts gravity like the first object considered to be a black hole is cygnus 
cygnus was the subject of a friendly wager between stephen hawking and fellow physicist kip thorne with hawking betting that the source was not a black hole 
in hawking conceded black holes may have formed immediately after the big bang 
rapidly expanding space may have squeezed some regions into tiny dense black holes less massive than the a star passes too close to a black hole the star can be torn apart estimate that the milky way has anywhere from million to billion stellar black holes with masses roughly three times that of the holes remain terrific fodder for science fiction books and movies

home news science astronomy rare missing link black hole apparently found by mike wall published february the newly discovered object ngc shown in inset appears to be an black hole astronomers say 
image credit et al et al optical and dss inset radio a newfound cosmic object may be a missing link that could help flesh out the black hole family object appears to be an black hole imbh astronomers say 
called it lies in an arm of the spiral galaxy about million from are thought to contain the mass of a few hundred to a few hundred thousand suns 
the black holes are therefore intermediate in size between black holes and the behemoths that lurk at the hearts of galaxies which can harbor billions of solar masses 
images black holes of the universe researchers have long hypothesized the existence of imbhs which are believed to be the seeds from which supermassive black holes grow 
but the midsize structures have proven elusive thus have been looking very hard for these black holes study tim roberts of the university of durham in the united kingdom said in a statement 
there have been hints that they exist but the imbhs have been acting like a relative that isnt interested in being and his colleagues led by mar mezcua of the center for astrophysics in cambridge massachusetts studied in light using nasas chandra observatoryand in radio light using the european very long baseline interferometry these observations with the known relationship between black hole mass and luminosity in and radio wavelengths the team calculated mass the equivalanet of about found that ngc has traits similar to both black holes and supermassive black holes said andrei lobanov of the max planck institute for radio astronomy in bonn germany 
in other words this object helps tie the whole black hole family researchers also noted that the black hole is firing off a powerful radio jet which extends about out into space 
young stars are missing along this path for or so suggesting that the jet has cleared out clouds of gas that otherwise would have condensed to form stars researchers separate study delves into the possible origin of the ngc black hole 
a team of researchers led by anna wolter of the national institute for astrophysics in milan italy used chandra observations to determine that the equivalent of five to suns are forming every year in the ngc galaxy 
this high rate suggests that the galaxy recently collided with a neighboring dwarf galaxy 
mergers generally spur star formation 
so ngc may actually have taken shape near the core of a dwarf galaxy astronomers studies will be published in the journal monthly notices of the royal astronomical mike wall on twitter michaeldwall and

home news science astronomy black holes may be the source of mysterious dark energy by stefanie waldek published february the origin of dark energy has been perplexing scientists for decades 
comments an illustration of a black hole 
image credit mark photo images when astronomers discovered that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate they theorized that some force must be pushing things farther apart and overcoming gravity which should be slowing things down 
that force was suggested to be dark energy but no one has ever figured out from where it a team of international researchers led by the university of hawaii has discovered the first evidence for the origin point of dark energy black holes acquire mass in two ways accretion of gas and mergers with other black holes 
but in studying nine billion years of black hole evolution in dormant giant elliptical galaxies the researchers discovered that the older black holes are much larger than they should be based on those two methods of growth 
that means there must be another way these black holes are acquiring mass 
researchers suggest the answer is dark energy in the form of vacuum energy a kind of energy included in spacetime itself that pushes the universe further apart accelerating the expansion according to a statement black holes everything you need to knowif the theory holds then this is going to revolutionize the whole of cosmology because at last weve got a solution for the origin of dark energy thats been perplexing cosmologists and theoretical physicists for more than years chris pearson of stfc ral space a of a study on the discovery said in a stories galactic collisions act as a cosmic delivery service for hungry monster black holes star survives spaghettification by black hole black holes at galactic centers blast out times more light than previously thoughtthe idea that black holes are a source of dark energy isnt new 
in fact its part of einsteins theory of general relativity 
but this is the first time astronomers have obtained observational evidence to support the really saying two things at once that theres evidence the typical black hole solutions dont work for you on a long long timescale and we have the first proposed astrophysical source for dark energy said study author duncan farrah university of hawaii astronomer in the paper on the teams research was published in the astrophysical journal letters on wednesday feb stefanie waldek on twitter stefaniewaldek

reply pentcho valev is the space inside say a galaxy growing but overcome by the gravitational attraction between the stars 
the answer is no 
space within any gravitationally bound system is unaffected by the surrounding expansion 
https sabine hossenfelder the solution of general relativity that describes the expanding universe is a solution on average it is good only on very large distances 
but the solutions that describe galaxies are different and just dont expand 
its not that galaxies expand unnoticeably they just dont 
the full solution then is both stitched together expanding space between galaxies it is only somewhere beyond the scales of galaxy clusters that expansion takes over 
http so cosmologists apply the expansion solutions only to voids deprived of galaxies to galaxies and galactic clusters they apply nonexpansion solutions 
why do cosmologists resort to this trick 
because if they applied expansion solutions to galaxies and galactic clusters observations would immediately disprove the expansion theory 
here is why if expansion is actual inside galaxies and galactic clusters the competition between expansion and gravitational attraction would distort those cosmic structures 
fringes only weakly bound by gravity would succumb to expansion and fly away 
and the theory if it takes into account the intragalactic expansion will have to predict the distortions 
but no distortions are observed there is really no expansion inside galaxies and galactic clusters 
and cosmologists without much publicity have simply made the theory consistent with this fact 
since there is no expansion inside galaxies and galactic clusters there is no expansion anywhere else 
the so called cosmological hubble redshift is due to the speed of light slowing down as photons travel through vacuum in a universe 
this is not a totally unacceptable idea some physicists however suggest that there might be one other cosmic factor that could influence the speed of light quantum vacuum fluctuation 
this theory holds that empty spaces in the universe arent actually empty theyre teeming with particles that are just constantly changing from existent to states 
quantum fluctuations therefore could slow down the speed of light 
https reply pertan black holes are the transformers of the universe 
works like vacuum cleaners 
it is a null energy 
they balance the universal energy 
what goes in generally negative energy and turns back into universe as positive energy 
if the negative energy is stubborn to be transformed it can stay in there as in an infinite loop 
can be called lost in space but it is a one way ticket 
because inside is null energy and vacuums the negative you can not call it dark energy 
it works for all positive

reply declantraill the new theory that preceded this new observation i would like to bring to your attention my paper on researchgate in about my idea that dark matter is actually caused by black holes 
the idea is that black holes consume the vacuum energy which has the effect of drawing inwards all embedded matter stars planets etc in the space surrounding the black holes 
thus an apparent extra inward acceleration which is constant with distance is produced and can explain galaxy rotation rates 
it also explains other phenomena such as the apparent lopsided halos of dark matter that seem to exist

home references science astronomy where do black holes lead to 
by david crookes daisy dobrijevic published january if you travel through a black hole where do you go 
where do black holes lead to 
image credit all about space magazine jump to are black holes wormholes 
black holes white holes black holes go nowhere do black holes even exist 
additional resources bibliography so there you are about to leap into a black hole 
what could possibly await should against all odds you somehow survive 
where would you end up and what tantalizing tales would you be able to regale if you managed to clamber your way back the simple answer to all of these questions is as professor richard massey explains who knows 
as a royal society research fellow at the institute for computational cosmology at durham university massey is fully aware that the mysteries of black holes run deep 
falling through an event horizon is literally passing beyond the veil once someone falls past it nobody could ever send a message back he said 
theyd be ripped to pieces by the enormous gravity so i doubt anyone falling through would get anywhere 
related black hole quiz how well do you know natures weirdest creations if that sounds like a disappointing and painful answer then it is to be expected 
ever since albert einsteins general theory of relativity was considered to have predicted black holes by linking with the action of gravity it has been known that black holes result from the death of a massive star leaving behind a small dense remnant core 
assuming this core has more than roughly three times the mass of the sun gravity would overwhelm to such a degree that it would fall in on itself into a single point or singularity understood to be the black holes infinitely dense core 
the resulting uninhabitable black hole would have such a powerful gravitational pull that not even light could avoid it 
so should you then find yourself at the event horizon the point at which light and matter can only pass inward as proposed by the german astronomer karl schwarzschild there is no escape 
according to massey tidal forces would reduce your body into strands of atoms or spaghettification as it is also known and the object would eventually end up crushed at the singularity 
the idea that you could pop out somewhere perhaps at the other side seems utterly about wormholes 
black holes are strange regions where gravity is strong enough to bend light warp space and distort time 
image credit karl tate contributor over the years scientists have looked into the possibility that black holes could be wormholes to other galaxies 
they may even be as some have suggested a path to another universe 
such an idea has been floating around for some time einstein teamed up with nathan rosen to theorise bridges that connect two different points in in 
but it gained some fresh ground in the when physicist kip thorne one of the worlds leading experts on the astrophysical implications of einsteins general theory of relativity raised a discussion about whether objects could physically travel through kip thornes popular book about wormholes is what first got me excited about physics as a child massey said 
but it doesnt seem likely that wormholes thorne who lent his expert advice to the production team for the hollywood movie interstellar wrote we see no objects in our universe that could become wormholes as they age in his book the science of interstellar norton and company 
thorne told that journeys through these theoretical tunnels would most likely remain science fiction and there is certainly no firm evidence that a black hole could allow for such a passage 
related the strangest black holes in the universebut the problem is that we cant get up close to see for ourselves 
why we cant even take photographs of anything that takes place inside a black hole if light can not escape their immense gravity then nothing can be snapped by a camera 
as it stands theory suggests that anything which goes beyond the event horizon is simply added to the black hole and whats more because time distorts close to this boundary this will appear to take place incredibly slowly so answers wont be quickly think the standard story is that they lead to the end of time said douglas finkbeiner professor of astronomy and physics at harvard university 
an observer far away will not see their astronaut friend fall into the black hole 
theyll just get redder and fainter as they approach the event horizon as a result of gravitational red shift 
but the friend falls right in to a place beyond forever 
whatever that concept of a wormhole 
if wormholes exist they might lead to another universe 
but theres no evidence that wormholes are real or that a black hole would act like one 
image credit shutterstock maybe a black hole leads to a white holecertainly if black holes do lead to another part of a galaxy or another universe there would need to be something opposite to them on the other side 
could this be a white hole a theory put forward by russian cosmologist igor novikov in 
novikov proposed that a black hole links to a white hole that exists in the past 
unlike a black hole a white hole will allow light and matter to leave but light and matter will not be able to have continued to explore the potential connection between black and white holes 
in their study published in the journal physical review d physicists carlo rovelli and hal haggard claimed that there is a classic metric satisfying the einstein equations outside a finite region where matter collapses into a black hole and then emerges from a while hole 
in other words all of the material black holes have swallowed could be spewed out and black holes may become white holes when they stephen hawkings most ideas about black how many black holes are there in the universe balding black holes prove einstein right again on general relativityfar from destroying the information that it absorbs the collapse of a black hole would be halted 
it would instead experience a quantum bounce allowing information to escape 
should this be the case it would shed some light on a proposal by former cambridge university cosmologist and theoretical physicist stephen hawking who in the explored the possibility that black holes emit particles and radiation thermal heat as a result of quantum said a black hole doesnt last forever finkbeiner said 
hawking calculated that the radiation would cause a black hole to lose energy shrink and disappear as described in his paper published in physical review given his claims that the radiation emitted would be random and contain no information about what had fallen in the black hole upon its explosion would erase loads of meant hawkings idea was at odds with quantum theory which says information cant be destroyed 
physics states information just becomes more difficult to find because should it become lost it becomes impossible to know the past or the future 
hawkings idea led to the black hole information paradox and it has long puzzled scientists 
some have said hawking was simply wrong and the man himself even declared he had made an error during a scientific conference in dublin in do we go back to the concept of black holes emitting preserved information and throwing it back out via a white hole 
in their study published in physical review letters jorge pullin at louisiana state university and rodolfo gambini at the university of the republic in montevideo uruguay applied loop quantum gravity to a black hole and found that gravity increased towards the core but reduced and plonked whatever was entering into another region of the universe 
the results gave extra credence to the idea of black holes serving as a portal 
in this study singularity does not exist and so it doesnt form an impenetrable barrier that ends up crushing whatever it encounters 
it also means that information doesnt black holes go nowhereyet physicists ahmed almheiri donald marolf joseph polchinski and james sully still believed hawking could have been on to something 
they worked on a theory that became known as the amps firewall or the black hole firewall hypothesis 
by their calculations quantum mechanics could feasibly turn the event horizon into a giant wall of fire and anything coming into contact would burn in an instant 
in that sense black holes lead nowhere because nothing could ever get inside 
this however violates einsteins general theory of relativity 
someone crossing the event horizon shouldnt actually feel any great hardship because an object would be in free fall and based on the equivalence principle that object or person would not feel the extreme effects of gravity 
it could follow the laws of physics present elsewhere in the universe but even if it didnt go against einsteins principle it would undermine quantum field theory or suggest information can be lost 
artists impression of a tidal disruption event which occurs when a star passes too close to a supermassive black hole 
image credit all about space magazine black hole of uncertaintystep forward hawking once more 
in he published a study in which he eschewed the existence of an event horizon meaning there is nothing there to burn saying gravitational collapse would produce an apparent horizon horizon would suspend light rays trying to move away from the core of the black hole and would persist for a period of time 
in his rethinking apparent horizons temporarily retain matter and energy before dissolving and releasing them later down the line 
this explanation best fits with quantum theory which says information cant be destroyed and if it was ever proven it suggests that anything could escape from a black went as far as saying black holes may not even exist 
black holes should be redefined as metastable bound states of the gravitational field he wrote 
there would be no singularity and while the apparent field would move inwards due to gravity it would never reach the center and be consolidated within a dense mass 
image credit karl tate contributor and yet anything which is emitted will not be in the form of the information swallowed 
it would be impossible to figure out what went in by looking at what is coming out which causes problems of its own not least for say a human who found themselves in such an alarming position 
theyd never feel the same again 
one things for sure this particular mystery is going to swallow up many more scientific hours for a long time to come 
rovelli and francesca vidotto recently suggested that a component of dark matter could be formed by remnants of evaporated black holes and hawkings paper on black holes and soft hair was released in and describes how particles are left around the point of no return the event horizon an idea that suggests information is not lost but flew in the face of the theorem which was expressed by physicist john archibald wheeler and worked on the basis that two black holes would be indistinguishable to an observer because none of the special particle physics would be conserved 
its an idea that has got scientists talking but there is some way to go before its seen as the answer for where black holes lead

home news science astronomy how many black holes are there in the universe 
by paul sutter published november short answer a lot 
artists illustration of a supermassive black hole emitting a jet of energetic particles 
image credit paul sutter is an astrophysicist at suny stony brook and the flatiron institute host of ask a spaceman and space radio and author of how to die in space 
sutter contributed this article to expert voices holes are notoriously hard to detect since they are as black as the space surrounding them 
we can only pinpoint them in special circumstances like when they pull down gas from a neighboring star or merge together releasing a flood of gravitational how many black holes are out there 
to answer the question astronomers have to turn to theoretical calculations to make estimates 
in a recent study researchers determined that there are potentially millions of small black holes in our cosmic neighborhood 
this means that about of all the matter in the universe is bound up inside black black holes of the universe images black hole ingredientsto make a black hole you need to make stars because black holes come from the deaths of stars 
so to figure out how many black holes are in the universe the researchers behind the study which recently appeared in the preprint journal arxiv and has been accepted for publication in the astrophysical journal had to take a few steps first step is to model galaxy evolution over the billions of years of cosmic history 
galaxies are the homes of stars after all and their overall evolution affects how many of each kind of star appears inside them 
for example some galaxies can steadily form new stars year after cosmic year 
others may suffer merger events that trigger a round of incredibly high star formation only for them to burn out and produce nothing of note ever astronomers took known observations of galaxy statistics across cosmic time noting the general trend of galactic merger rates and demographics 
another key factor is the metallicity of a galaxy which is a measure of the amount of elements other than hydrogen and helium inside a galaxy astronomers call these metals 
bigger galaxies will have more gas which enables them to form more stars 
but more metals can enhance the cooling of gas which in turn helps galaxies to efficiently churn out new stars 
black hole recipeswith these building blocks the astronomers had a model of the stellar population within galaxies telling them how many small stars medium stars and big stars appear in the then they needed to trace the evolution and most importantly deaths of those stars 
to do that they turned to simulations which connect the properties of a particular star its mass and metallicity to its lifetime and eventual demise 
only a fraction of the very largest stars produce black holes and those simulations tell the astronomers what percentage of a galaxys stars go every the astronomers had to track the evolution of binary systems as black holes can feed off of sibling stars becoming engorged on their gas in the process 
thus a black hole formed in a binary system will end up being larger than a black hole born the black holes age they continue to feed on any surrounding gas which the astronomers also estimated 
lastly occasionally black holes find each other in the darkness of interstellar space and merge together 
so to produce an accurate survey the astronomers had to estimate the rate of mergers within each scientists spot merger of two mismatched black holesrelated stories happens at the center of a black hole 
holes facts theories and definitions black holes may flood the universe 
could one hit earth the great black hole censusputting all the pieces together the astronomers were able to track the population of black holes over the course of billions of years 
they produced what is called a mass function which is a sort of astronomical census reporting how many of each size of black hole exists at any point in surprisingly the largest black holes called supermassive black holes are much rarer than their smaller cousins 
the researchers found that in every cubic megaparsec of space where a megaparsec is one million parsecs or million our universe hosts roughly million solar masses worth of black holes 
if each black hole is a few times the mass of the sun that translates to around million individual black holes in that same put that in perspective the total amount of mass contained by black holes is about of the mass contained in stars 
so for all the stars you see in the night sky there are a lot of black holes lurking between black holes on the other hand are extremely rare with each galaxy usually hosting only one of those black holes account for about of all the baryonic as in not dark matter matter in the cosmos today 
by far most of the baryonic matter is found in loose still thats nothing to sneeze at and it means that black holes are frighteningly common

home news science astronomy the milky ways monster black hole has a cool gas halo literally by charles choi last updated may this artists impression shows a ring of cool interstellar gas around the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way sagittarius a 
image credit dagnello for the first time astronomers may have imaged the cool disk of gas surrounding the gigantic black hole at the heart of the milky way a new study research may improve knowledge about how black holes grow and influence their the hearts of most if not all galaxies are supermassive black holes millions to billions of times the mass of the sun 
these enormous structures can have profound effects on the galaxies they call home for example they can blast out jets of matter at nearly the speed of light that can travel across an entire galaxy likely shaping the galaxys the strangest black holes in the universe the location of the black hole at the center of the milky way sagittarius a 
image credit baganoff et at the center of our galaxy lies the supermassive black hole sagittarius a often abbreviated sgr a 
this giant is about million times the mass of the sun and about million miles million kilometers in sgr a swirls a ring of debris known as an accretion disk 
the gas within this disk experiences so much friction that it can reach million degrees fahrenheit million degrees celsius according to researchers on the new study 
previous research has detected near sgr a likely given off from this hot research suggests that sgr a was also surrounded by relatively cool gas with temperatures ranging from about minus degrees f to degrees f minus degrees c to degrees c 
however it remains uncertain how much cool gas surrounded sgr a we want to learn about what processes are important and not important for how a black hole gets fed we need to know the environment around the black hole well study lead author elena murchikova an astrophysicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey told 
but the contribution of cool gas on a black hole has never been murchikova and her colleagues suggest that they may have imaged the cool accretion disk around sgr a for the first time 
this should help improve our understanding of how accretion onto black holes works she used the atacama large array alma in chile to analyze the center of the milky way 
specifically they focused on wavelengths of light given off by hot ionized hydrogen gas that could make it all the way from the heart of the galaxy to earth with very little loss of these light signals along the image from alma shows cool hydrogen gas flowing around the milky way centers supermassive black hole sagittarius a 
the red portion of the gas is moving away from earth and the blue portion is moving toward earth 
the crosshairs show the location of the black hole 
image credit alma murchikova dagnello the researchers detected a disk of cool gas about times the diameter of sgr a and estimated it was about the mass of jupiter or about times the mass of earth 
future research should aim for images of the cool gas around black holes and how this gas interacts with hot gas around black holes murchikova said

its strong inescapable gravitational pull has an event horizon times the diameter of neptunes orbit incredible billion miles billion kilometers in these numbers the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way is a pipsqueak

the environment within the galaxy is now so peaceful that stars are forming from its remaining gas and orbiting undisturbed around the black black hole used to be fueled by galactic material such as gas and dust which fell inward and created a spinning disk of material known as an accretion disc 
the black holes strong gravity accelerated the material and heated it to millions of degrees with the material sending out huge jets and energy would have made the galaxy system a quasar one of the brightest celestial objects in the universe 
at that time it would have sent out energy up to times stronger than what we see from the milky way 
although the material is now gone ngc still is a useful object for astronomers to better understand the evolution of huge mass of the black hole was determined using instruments on two telescopes the keck ii observatory and the gemini north telescope

home news science astronomy scientists just found the biggest neutron star or smallest black hole yet in a strange cosmic collision by meghan bartels last updated june whatever it is scientists are excited 
comments astrophysicists have spotted the strangest signal yet an observation that could force scientists to rewrite what they know about the waves form when massive objects distort spacetime surrounding them and send ripples out across the universe 
scientists caught the detection of such waves formed by two colliding black holes in then gravitational wave detections have only gotten stranger and scientists have only gotten more excited 
now a group of researchers has announced the first detection of a signal created by a collision involving an object larger than the largest known neutron star but smaller than the smallest known black hole 
although the detection is too complicated for scientists to ever hope to pin down precisely what happened the signal raises hopes for more strange observations to come 
this detection could even herald a new understanding of how massive stellar explosions called supernovas a fantastic event it will really change how we understand the formation of black holes and neutron stars christopher berry a gravitational wave astronomer at northwestern university and the university of glasgow and on the new research told 
it will remain a mystery until we can get more observations but that doesnt mean its not the search for gravitational waves in imagesan artists depiction of the heavily asymmetrical collision observed through gravitational waves 
image credit fischer ossokine pfeiffer buonanno max planck institute for gravitational physics simulating extreme spacetimes sxs collaboration were very confident in the results this is a really beautiful signal he said 
its a wonderful clean chirp if you look at the data 
i couldnt believe it the first time i saw it its caught the gravitational wave or the chirp on and were further intrigued when initial analysis suggested that the collision could have merged a black hole and a neutron star 
the collision of those two objects is a type of gravitational wave event that scientists have eagerly been awaiting since so far they have only seen mergers of matched as the astrophysicists ran more analyses on the data they realized they were looking at something even stranger 
according to scientists analysis of the merger event one of the colliding objects was about times the mass of our sun thats a black hole and the other about times the mass of our sun thats a well thats mystery a chart depicting the range of collision events observed through gravitational waves 
the bottom section of the image shows objects the top section shows objects 
the new detection highlighted here involved a black hole and what is either a very large neutron star or a very small black hole 
image credit frank elavsky aaron geller northwestern this size falls into what scientists call the mass gap an object significantly smaller than any black hole studied to date about times the mass of the sun but also probably larger than any known neutron star about times the mass of the sun of a mixed nature black holes and neutron stars have been predicted for decades but this compact object in the mass gap is a complete surprise vicky kalogera an astrophysicist at northwestern university said in a statement 
even though we cant classify the object with conviction we have seen either the heaviest known neutron star or the lightest known black hole 
either way it breaks a other circumstances scientists may have been able to determine what the object actually was before the collision that created the observable chirp 
but fate didnt cooperate here 
scientists didnt spot any light signal that a neutron star could have produced but that doesnt rule out that it could have been a neutron unlike the generally collisions scientists have studied to date this pair is hugely uneven with the larger object containing about nine times the mass of the smaller one making it even more difficult for scientists to see details of the event in the gravitational wave chirp 
i think of eating a little dot kalogera said in the statement 
when the masses are highly asymmetric the smaller compact object can be eaten by the black hole in one event was also difficult to study because it was quite far away 
the collision appears to have occurred about million away from earth for context thats about six times more distant than the binary neutron star merger detected in august by its accompanying flash of of these challenges to really crack the mystery of the cosmic mass gap scientists will need to observe more of these borderline objects in more collisions preferably collisions that arent quite so complicated to analyze 
a more binary would be great one closer even better berry artists depiction of two black holes one more than nine times more massive than the other spiraling into each other and colliding 
image credit fischer ossokine pfeiffer buonanno max planck institute for gravitational physics simulating extreme spacetimes sxs collaboration and pinning down the fuzzy realm between neutron star and black hole isnt important just for precisions sake berry said it will change our understanding of the universe around one thing it will tell scientists about how neutron stars which berry called the ultimate particle colliders work 
neutron star matter is very difficult to model he said 
its nothing we can simulate here on earth the conditions are too extreme 
but the properties of that matter will determine the maximum size of a neutron star the point at which a large neutron star becomes too large and collapses the boundary that observations like this new research will help pin understanding the mass gap or lack thereof would ripple through astrophysics far beyond these observations berry said 
for decades now astrophysics models have assumed that there is indeed a gap between the largest neutron stars and the smallest black holes 
if that gap turns out to be significantly smaller than previously assumed or nonexistent those models will need to be tweaked 
those tweaked models could change our understanding of the universe more broadly than the mass gap definition itself berry the mass gap mystery unfolds this new signal points to the rich future of gravitational wave observations berry is testament to the fact that we are only just starting to explore the universe with gravitational waves he said 
we dont know whats out there 
weve seen some of the more common sources now we know what the typical type of gravitational waves are 
but the full complexity what the rare beasts in the jungle are were still trying to find research is described in a paper published today june in astrophysical journal letters

home references science astronomy what happens at the center of a black hole 
by paul sutter last updated february all of the possibilities are very weird 
artists illustration of a black hole 
image credit shutterstock jump to planck stars gravastars lets go for a spin additional resources paul sutter is an astrophysicist at suny stony brook and the flatiron institute host of ask a spaceman and space radio and author of how to die in space 
sutter contributed this article to expert voices singularity at the center of a black hole is the ultimate no mans land a place where matter is compressed down to an infinitely tiny point and all conceptions of time and space completely break down 
and it doesnt really exist 
something has to replace the singularity but were not exactly sure what 
lets explore some black holes of the universe images planck starsit could be that deep inside a black hole matter doesnt get squished down to an infinitely tiny point 
instead there could be a smallest possible configuration of matter the tiniest possible pocket of is called a planck star and its a theoretical possibility envisioned by loop quantum gravity which is itself a highly hypothetical proposal for creating a quantum version of gravity 
in the world of loop quantum gravity space and time are quantized the universe around us is composed of tiny discrete chunks but at such an incredibly tiny scale that our movements appear smooth and theoretical chunkiness of provides two benefits 
one it takes the dream of quantum mechanics to its ultimate conclusion explaining gravity in a natural way 
and two it makes it impossible for singularities to form inside black matter squishes down under the immense gravitational weight of a collapsing star it meets resistance 
the discreteness of prevents matter from reaching anything smaller than the planck length around times meters 
all the material that has ever fallen into the black hole gets compressed into a ball not much bigger than this 
perfectly microscopic but definitely not infinitely resistance to continued compression eventually forces the material to explode making black holes only temporary objects 
but because of the extreme time dilation effects around black holes from our perspective in the outside universe it takes billions even trillions of years before they go boom 
so were all set for what is gravity gravastarsanother attempt to eradicate the singularity one that doesnt rely on untested theories of quantum gravity is known as the gravastar 
its such a theoretical concept that my spell checker didnt even recognize the word 
the difference between a black hole and a gravastar is that instead of a singularity the gravastar is filled with dark energy 
dark energy is a substance that permeates causing it to expand outward 
it sounds like but its real dark energy is currently in operation in the larger cosmos causing our entire universe to accelerate in its matter falls onto a gravastar it isnt able to actually penetrate the event horizon due to all that dark energy on the inside and therefore just hangs out on the surface 
but outside that surface gravastars look and act like normal black holes 
a black holes event horizon is its point of no return the boundary beyond which nothing not even light can escape 
however recent observations of merging black holes with gravitational wave detectors have potentially ruled out the existence of gravastars because merging gravastars will give a different signal than merging black holes and outfits like ligo the laser interferometer observatory and virgo are getting more and more examples by the day 
while gravastars arent exactly a in our universe they are definitely on thin universe big bang to now in easy stepsrelated stories what are black holes 
facts theories and definition einsteins theory of general relativity the hunt for wormholes how scientists look for tunnelslets go for a spinplanck stars and gravastars may have awesome names but the reality of their existence is in doubt 
so maybe theres a more mundane explanation for singularities one thats based on a more nuanced and realistic view of black holes in our idea of a single point of infinite density comes from our conception of stationary uncharged rather boring black holes 
real black holes are much more interesting characters especially when they spin of a rotating black hole stretches the singularity into a ring 
and according to the math of einsteins theory of general relativity which is the only math weve got once you pass through the ring singularity you enter a wormhole and pop out through a white hole the polar opposite of a black hole where nothing can enter and matter rushes out at the speed of light into an entirely new and exciting patch of the challenge the interiors of rotating black holes are catastrophically unstable 
and this is according to the very same math that leads to the prediction of the problem with rotating black holes is that well they rotate 
the singularity stretched into a ring is rotating at such a fantastic pace that it has incredible centrifugal force 
and in general relativity strong enough centrifugal forces act like antigravity they push not creates a boundary inside the black hole called the inner horizon 
outside this region radiation is falling inward toward the singularity compelled by the extreme gravitational pull 
but radiation is pushed by the antigravity near the ring singularity and the turning point is the inner horizon 
if you were to encounter the inner horizon you would face a wall of infinitely energetic radiation the entire past history of the universe blasted into your face in less than a blink of an formation of an inner horizon sows the seeds for the destruction of the black hole 
but rotating black holes certainly exist in our universe so that tells us that our math is wrong and something funky is going really happening inside a black hole 
we dont know and the scary part is that we may never resourcesyou can learn more about black holes at this nasa explainer page 
this bbc earth piece has good basic information about black holes as well and it also describes what would happen to you if you fell into one of these monsters 
and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy has a good detailed breakdown of black holes and singularities

by fraser cain universe today sagittarius a 
credit chandra want to hear something cool 
theres a black hole at the center of the milky way 
and not just any black hole its a supermassive black hole with more than million times the mass of the sun 
its right over there in the direction of the sagittarius constellation 
and as we speak its in the process of tearing apart entire stars and star systems occasionally consuming them adding to its mass like a voracious shark 
wait that doesnt sound cool that sort of sounds a little scary 
dont worry you have absolutely nothing to worry about unless you plan to live for quadrillions of years which i do thanks to my future robot body 
im ready for my singularity kurzweil 
is the supermassive black hole going to consume the milky way 
if not why not 
if so why so 
the discovery of a supermassive black hole at the heart of the milky way and really almost all galaxies is one of my favorite discoveries in the field of astronomy 
its one of those insights that simultaneously answered some questions and opened up even more 
back in the the astronomers bruce balick and robert brown realized that there was an intense source of radio emissions coming from the very center of the milky way in the constellation sagittarius 
credit universe today they designated it sgr a 
the asterisk stands for exciting 
you think im joking but im not 
for once im not joking 
in astronomers observed that there were stars zipping past this object like comets on elliptical paths going around the sun 
imagine the mass of our sun and the tremendous power it would take to wrench a star like that around 
the only objects with that much density and gravity are black holes but in this case a black hole with millions of times the mass of our own sun a supermassive black hole 
with the discovery of the milky ways supermassive black hole astronomers found evidence that there are black holes at the heart of every galaxy 
at the same time the discovery of supermassive black holes helped answer one of the big questions in astronomy what are quasars 
we did a whole article on them but theyre intensely bright objects generating enough light they can be seen billions of away 
giving off more energy than the rest of their own galaxy combined 
it turns out that quasars and supermassive black holes are the same thing 
quasars are just black holes in the process of actively feeding gobbling up so much material it piles up in an accretion disk around it 
once again these do sound terrifying 
but are we in any danger 
in the short term no 
the black hole at the center of the milky way is away 
even if it turned into a quasar and started eating stars you wouldnt even be able to notice it from this distance 
an illustration of saggitarius a 
credit a black hole is just a concentration of mass in a very small region which things orbit around 
to give you an example you could replace the sun with a black hole with the exact same mass and nothing would change 
i mean wed all freeze because there wasnt a sun in the sky anymore but the earth would continue to orbit this black hole in exactly the same orbit for billions of years 
same goes with the black hole at the center of the milky way 
its not pulling material in like a vacuum cleaner it serves as a gravitational anchor for a group of stars to orbit around for billions of years 
in order for a black hole to actually consume a star it needs to make a direct hit 
to get within the event horizon which is only about times bigger than the sun 
if a star gets close without hitting itll get torn apart but still it doesnt happen very often 
the problem happens when these stars interact with one another through their own gravity and mess with each others orbits 
a star that would have been orbiting happily for billions of years might get deflected into a collision course with the black hole 
but this happens very rarely 
over the short term that supermassive black hole is totally harmless 
especially from out here in the galactic suburbs 
but there are a few situations that might cause some problems over vast periods of time 
the first panic will happen when the milky way collides with andromeda in about billion years lets call this mess milkdromeda 
suddenly youll have two whole clouds of stars interacting in all kinds of ways like an unstable blended family 
stars that would have been safe will careen past other stars and be deflected down into the maw of either of the two supermassive black holes on hand 
andromedas black hole could be million times the mass of the sun so its a bigger target for stars with a death wish 
the quasar sdss has the most energetic outflows ever seen at least five times more powerful than any that have been observed to date 
calçada over the coming billions trillions and quadrillions of years more and more galaxies will collide with milkdromeda bringing new supermassive black holes and more stars to the chaos 
so many opportunities for mayhem 
of course the sun will die in about billion years so this future wont be our problem 
well fine with my eternal robot body it might still be my problem 
after our neighborhood is completely out of galaxies to consume then there will just be countless eons of time for stars to interact for orbit after orbit 
some will get flung out of milkdromeda some will be hurled down into the black hole 
and others will be safe assuming they can avoid this fate over the googol years itll take for the supermassive black hole to finally evaporate 
thats a followed by zeroes years 
thats a really really long time so now i dont like those odds 
for our purposes the black hole at the heart of the milky way is completely and totally safe 
in the lifetime of the sun it wont interact with us in any way or consume more than a handful of stars 
but over the vast eons it could be a different story 
i hope we can be around to find out the answer

home news science astronomy black holes may be the source of mysterious dark energy by stefanie waldek published february the origin of dark energy has been perplexing scientists for decades 
comments an illustration of a black hole 
image credit mark photo images when astronomers discovered that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate they theorized that some force must be pushing things farther apart and overcoming gravity which should be slowing things down 
that force was suggested to be dark energy but no one has ever figured out from where it a team of international researchers led by the university of hawaii has discovered the first evidence for the origin point of dark energy black holes acquire mass in two ways accretion of gas and mergers with other black holes 
but in studying nine billion years of black hole evolution in dormant giant elliptical galaxies the researchers discovered that the older black holes are much larger than they should be based on those two methods of growth 
that means there must be another way these black holes are acquiring mass 
researchers suggest the answer is dark energy in the form of vacuum energy a kind of energy included in spacetime itself that pushes the universe further apart accelerating the expansion according to a statement black holes everything you need to knowif the theory holds then this is going to revolutionize the whole of cosmology because at last weve got a solution for the origin of dark energy thats been perplexing cosmologists and theoretical physicists for more than years chris pearson of stfc ral space a of a study on the discovery said in a stories galactic collisions act as a cosmic delivery service for hungry monster black holes star survives spaghettification by black hole black holes at galactic centers blast out times more light than previously thoughtthe idea that black holes are a source of dark energy isnt new 
in fact its part of einsteins theory of general relativity 
but this is the first time astronomers have obtained observational evidence to support the really saying two things at once that theres evidence the typical black hole solutions dont work for you on a long long timescale and we have the first proposed astrophysical source for dark energy said study author duncan farrah university of hawaii astronomer in the paper on the teams research was published in the astrophysical journal letters on wednesday feb stefanie waldek on twitter stefaniewaldek

see all comments comments comment from the forums murgatroyd the explainer video in the article explained exactly nothing 
reply pentcho valev is the space inside say a galaxy growing but overcome by the gravitational attraction between the stars 
the answer is no 
space within any gravitationally bound system is unaffected by the surrounding expansion 
https sabine hossenfelder the solution of general relativity that describes the expanding universe is a solution on average it is good only on very large distances 
but the solutions that describe galaxies are different and just dont expand 
its not that galaxies expand unnoticeably they just dont 
the full solution then is both stitched together expanding space between galaxies it is only somewhere beyond the scales of galaxy clusters that expansion takes over 
http so cosmologists apply the expansion solutions only to voids deprived of galaxies to galaxies and galactic clusters they apply nonexpansion solutions 
why do cosmologists resort to this trick 
because if they applied expansion solutions to galaxies and galactic clusters observations would immediately disprove the expansion theory 
here is why if expansion is actual inside galaxies and galactic clusters the competition between expansion and gravitational attraction would distort those cosmic structures 
fringes only weakly bound by gravity would succumb to expansion and fly away 
and the theory if it takes into account the intragalactic expansion will have to predict the distortions 
but no distortions are observed there is really no expansion inside galaxies and galactic clusters 
and cosmologists without much publicity have simply made the theory consistent with this fact 
since there is no expansion inside galaxies and galactic clusters there is no expansion anywhere else 
the so called cosmological hubble redshift is due to the speed of light slowing down as photons travel through vacuum in a universe 
this is not a totally unacceptable idea some physicists however suggest that there might be one other cosmic factor that could influence the speed of light quantum vacuum fluctuation 
this theory holds that empty spaces in the universe arent actually empty theyre teeming with particles that are just constantly changing from existent to states 
quantum fluctuations therefore could slow down the speed of light 
https reply pertan black holes are the transformers of the universe 
works like vacuum cleaners 
it is a null energy 
they balance the universal energy 
what goes in generally negative energy and turns back into universe as positive energy 
if the negative energy is stubborn to be transformed it can stay in there as in an infinite loop 
can be called lost in space but it is a one way ticket 
because inside is null energy and vacuums the negative you can not call it dark energy 
it works for all positive 
reply lara or we dont understand gravity and for that reason and others dont know how far away things really are and all of this is just nonsense reply vulvox admin said black holes may be the origin of dark energy according to a study by a team of researchers led by the university of hawaii 
black holes may be the source of mysterious dark energy read morei dont understand how black holes would cause repulsion instead of pulling the universe closer together 
reply declantraill the new theory that preceded this new observation i would like to bring to your attention my paper on researchgate in about my idea that dark matter is actually caused by black holes 
the idea is that black holes consume the vacuum energy which has the effect of drawing inwards all embedded matter stars planets etc in the space surrounding the black holes 
thus an apparent extra inward acceleration which is constant with distance is produced and can explain galaxy rotation rates 
it also explains other phenomena such as the apparent lopsided halos of dark matter that seem to exist 
you can read about why this occurs and other details in my paper here an explanation for galaxy rotation rates without requiring dark matter https regards declan traill bsc melb reply view all comments show more comments more from space new rocket aborts launch galactic carrier plane flies for time since mystery objects shot down by us likely werent spy craft biden holes may be the source of mysterious dark from space

rather it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area think of a star ten times more massive than the sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of new york city 
the result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing not even light can escape 
in recent years nasa instruments have painted a new picture of these strange objects that are to many the most fascinating objects in space 
intense flares thought to be caused by a black hole devouring a star 
video watch the video the idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape it has been around for centuries 
most famously black holes were predicted by einsteins theory of general relativity which showed that when a massive star dies it leaves behind a small dense remnant core 
if the cores mass is more than about three times the mass of the sun the equations showed the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole 
a video about black holes 
watch the video scientists cant directly observe black holes with telescopes that detect light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation 
we can however infer the presence of black holes and study them by detecting their effect on other matter nearby 
if a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter for example it will draw matter inward in a process known as accretion 
a similar process can occur if a normal star passes close to a black hole 
in this case the black hole can tear the star apart as it pulls it toward itself 
as the attracted matter accelerates and heats up it emits that radiate into space 
recent discoveries offer some tantalizing evidence that black holes have a dramatic influence on the neighborhoods around them emitting powerful gamma ray bursts devouring nearby stars and spurring the growth of new stars in some areas while stalling it in others 
one stars end is a black holes beginning most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion 
smaller stars become dense neutron stars which are not massive enough to trap light 
if the total mass of the star is large enough about three times the mass of the sun it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity 
however as the star collapses a strange thing occurs 
as the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the event horizon time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away 
when the surface reaches the event horizon time stands still and the star can collapse no more it is a frozen collapsing object 
astronomers have identified a candidate for the black hole 
video watch the video even bigger black holes can result from stellar collisions 
soon after its launch in december nasas swift telescope observed the powerful fleeting flashes of light known as gamma ray bursts 
chandra and nasas hubble space telescope later collected data from the events afterglow and together the observations led astronomers to conclude that the powerful explosions can result when a black hole and a neutron star collide producing another black hole 
babies and giants although the basic formation process is understood one perennial mystery in the science of black holes is that they appear to exist on two radically different size scales 
on the one end there are the countless black holes that are the remnants of massive stars 
peppered throughout the universe these stellar mass black holes are generally to times as massive as the sun 
astronomers spot them when another star draws near enough for some of the matter surrounding it to be snared by the black holes gravity churning out in the process 
most stellar black holes however are very difficult to detect 
judging from the number of stars large enough to produce such black holes however scientists estimate that there are as many as ten million to a billion such black holes in the milky way alone 
on the other end of the size spectrum are the giants known as supermassive black holes which are millions if not billions of times as massive as the sun 
astronomers believe that supermassive black holes lie at the center of virtually all large galaxies even our own milky way 
astronomers can detect them by watching for their effects on nearby stars and gas 
this chart shows the relative masses of cosmic objects 
read the full article historically astronomers have long believed that no black holes exist 
however recent evidence from chandra and hubble strengthens the case that black holes do exist 
one possible mechanism for the formation of supermassive black holes involves a chain reaction of collisions of stars in compact star clusters that results in the buildup of extremely massive stars which then collapse to form black holes 
the star clusters then sink to the center of the galaxy where the black holes merge to form a supermassive black hole

home news science astronomy mysterious black holes may lurk at the centers of small galaxies by charles choi published may an image of the galaxy messier compiling data from nasas chandra observatory hubble space telescope and spitzer space telescope 
the black hole is the brightest object in the inset at about oclock near the galaxys center 
the hearts of small galaxies may hide a mysterious kind of black hole that has long proved elusive black holes with masses between the mass of a few suns and that of millions of suns a new study the decades astronomers have detected many examples of two kinds of black holes black holes and supermassive black holes 
black holes are up to a few times the suns mass and are thought to arise when giant stars die and collapse in on themselves whereas supermassive black holes are millions to billions of times the suns mass and form the hearts of most if not all large galaxies 
much remains unknown about the origins of supermassive black holes they seem to have grown extraordinarily fast and appeared early in cosmic history but researchers dont know exactly how 
one theory involves black holes those with masses between and million solar masses that previous research suggested might serve as the middle stages between and supermassive black holes 
however evidence for these missing links remains scant 
the strangest black holes in the universe now researchers say they may have detected black holes in the hearts of galaxies including five that were previously unknown 
these new findings suggest that black holes may lurk within the centers of many small galaxies the scientists black holes are ubiquitous in the local universe study lead author igor chilingarian an astronomer at both the smithsonian astrophysical observatory in cambridge massachusetts and moscow state university in russia told 
black holes are strange regions where gravity is strong enough to bend light warp space and distort time 
see how black holes work in this infographic 
image credit karl tate contributor black holes of any kind are challenging to spot because as their name suggests they are black making them difficult to see against the blackness of space 
one way to detect black holes indirectly is by looking for extraordinarily bright galactic cores 
prior work suggested that these active galactic nuclei are likely black holes that unleash vast amounts of energy as gigantic clouds of gas accrete or fall into hunt for black holes the new studys researchers first analyzed data on about million galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey looking for the kind of light typically seen from accreting black holes 
after they detected potential black holes residing in galactic cores they searched data from the chandra and swift orbital observatories for that would serve as strong evidence that these candidates were in fact black are very faint sources of at the centers of galaxies avi loeb chair of astronomy at harvard university told 
because theyre faint they cant be seen at great distances so the researchers had to look at the nearby universe 
its very challenging to see these sources because there are also stars at the centers of galaxies and the researchers needed to distinguish these sources from stars all around it 
this is why many of these sources were not seen before 
loeb was not involved with the new researchers detected active galactic nuclei that they suggested were black holes ranging in mass from about to solar are the black holes at the centers of galaxies that we know about loeb said 
the detection of these black holes in the centers of nearby dwarf galaxies indicates that you can in fact have black holes well below a million solar masses in size at the centers of researchers found that the greater the masses of the black holes were the larger the central bulges of stars usually were in the galaxies that hosted them 
a similar relationship is also seen with supermassive black holes loeb said 
this suggests the same process that builds black holes also builds galaxies it starts with smaller galaxies and is seen in bigger galaxies he said 
no escape dive into a black hole infographic loeb expected to see black holes in the centers of many small galaxies 
if you go back in time to the early universe these were the most common galaxies loeb said 
galaxy formation is a hierarchical process galaxies start small and grow in mass by mergers and by accreting more research can explore how supermassive black holes originated 
one possibility is that black holes grew from black holes that rapidly devoured gas around them in the early universe and that mergers of black holes helped create supermassive black holes loeb said 
observatories could detect such mergers in the future he there are other possible origins for both and supermassive black holes that scientists need to explore loeb said 
for instance black holes could have originated from the collisions of stars in extremely dense star clusters 
in addition black holes to million solar masses in size could have formed from collapsing massive gas clouds in the early universe he more we can learn about the origins of and supermassive black holes the more we can understand about the evolution of galaxies and the universe loeb and his colleagues are now using one of the magellan telescopes in chile to improve their estimates of masses and they hope to inspect promising candidates with the chandra observatory 
chilingarian also noted that if the erosita space telescope launches as planned in the number of confirmed black holes will grow by an order of and his colleagues detailed their findings online may in a study submitted to the astrophysical charles choi on twitter cqchoi

scientists photograph a black hole for the time by mike wall published april black holes have finally been dragged out of the shadows 
the event horizon telescope a array of eight radio telescopes forged through international collaboration captured this image of the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy and its shadow 
image credit eht collaboration black holes have finally been dragged out of the the first time ever humanity has photographed one of these elusive cosmic beasts shining light on an exotic realm that had long been beyond our ken 
we have seen what we thought was unseeable sheperd doeleman of harvard university and the center for astrophysics said today april during a press conference at the national press club in washington what exactly is a black hole event horizon and what happens there doeleman directs the event horizon telescope eht project which captured the epic imagery 
these four photos which were unveiled today at press events around the world and in a series of published papers outline the contours of the monster black hole lurking at the heart of the elliptical galaxy imagery is enough in its own right 
but even more significant is the trail the new results will likely blaze researchers really a new field to explore peter galison a professor of physics and the history of science at harvard said in an eht talk last month at the south by southwest sxsw festival in austin texas 
and thats ultimately whats so exciting about who harvards interdisciplinary black hole initiative bhi compared the imagerys potential impact to that of the drawings made by english scientist robert hooke in the 
these illustrations showed people what insects and plants look like through a opened a world galison said of hookes work 
a telescope the size of earththe eht is a consortium of more than scientists that has been in the works for about two decades 
its a truly international endeavor funding over the years has come from the national science foundation and many other organizations in countries around the project takes its name from a black holes famed point of no return the boundary beyond which nothing not even light can escape the objects gravitational event horizon is the ultimate prison wall bhi founding director avi loeb the chair of harvards astronomy department told 
loeb is not part of the eht team 
once youre in you can never get therefore impossible to photograph the interior of a black hole unless you somehow manage to get in there yourself 
you and your pictures couldnt make it back to the outside world of course 
so the eht images the event horizon mapping out the black holes dark silhouette 
the disk of gas swirling around and into black holes emits lots of radiation so such silhouettes stand out 
were looking for the loss of photons eht science council member dan marrone an associate professor of astronomy at the university of arizona told project has been scrutinizing two black holes the behemoth which harbors about billion times the mass of earths sun and our own milky way galaxys central black hole known as sagittarius a 
this latter object while still a supermassive black hole is a runt compared to beast containing a mere million solar of these objects are tough targets because of their immense distance from earth 
sagittarius a lies about from us and black hole is a whopping million our perspective sagittarius a s event horizon is so small that its the equivalent of seeing an orange on the moon or being able to read the newspaper in los angeles while youre sitting in new york city doeleman said during the sxsw event last single telescope on earth can make that observation so doeleman and the rest of the eht team had to get creative 
the researchers have linked up radio telescopes in arizona spain mexico antarctica and other places around the world forming a virtual instrument the size of earth 
related images black holes of the universeso much datathe eht team has used this megascope to study the two supermassive black holes for two weeklong stretches to date once in april and again the following year 
the new imagery comes from the first observing are good reasons why its taken two years for the projects first result to come out 
for one thing each night of observing generated about petabyte of data resulting in such a haul that the team has to move its information from place to place the no way that we can transfer this data through the internet eht project scientist dimitrios psaltis an astronomy professor at the university of arizona said at the sxsw event 
so what we actually do is we take our hard drives and we fedex them from place to place 
this is much faster than any cable that you can ever slows and complicates analysis of course 
data from the eht scope near the south pole for example couldnt get off antarctica until december when it was warm enough for planes to go in and out marrone and calibrating the data was also tricky he added 
and the team took great care with this work given the momentous nature of the youre going to come with a big claim of imaging a black hole you have to have big evidence very strong evidence doeleman said at the sxsw event which served as an explainer of the eht effort but did not announce any results on our project we often think that people like albert einstein arthur eddington and karl schwarzschild are kind of looking over our shoulders he added referring to physicists who helped pioneer our understanding of black holes 
and when you have luminaries kind of virtually checking your work you really want to get it the strangest black holes in the universea simulated image by the university of arizona shows the turbulent plasma in the extreme environment around a supermassive black hole 
image credit university of arizona what it all meansthe eht project has two main goals psaltis said to image an event horizon for the first time ever and to help determine if einsteins theory of general relativity needs any einstein came along gravity was generally regarded as a mysterious force at a distance 
but general relativity describes it as the warping of massive objects such as planets stars and black holes create a sort of sag in much as a bowling ball would if placed on a trampoline 
nearby objects follow this curve and get funneled toward the central mass 
general relativity has held up incredibly well over the century since its introduction passing every test that scientists have thrown at it 
but the ehts observations provide another trial in an extreme realm where predictions may not match reality 
thats because astronomers can calculate the expected size and shape of an event horizon using general relativity psaltis explained 
if the observed silhouette matches the simulations then einstein was right psaltis said 
if the answer is no then we have to tweak his theory in order to make it work with experiments 
this is how science we learned today that no tweaks are needed at least at the moment ehts observations are consistent with general relativity team members said 
namely the event horizon is nearly circular and is the right size for a black hole of that immense have to admit i was a little stunned that it matched so closely the predictions that we had made eht team member avery broderick of the university of waterloo and the perimeter institute for theoretical physics in canada said during todays news is vital to the scientific process of course 
indeed providing better information to feed into theories and simulations will likely be one of the ehts biggest contributions loeb said 
doing physics is a dialog with nature he said 
we test our ideas by comparing them to experiments experimental data is new results should also help scientists get a better handle on black holes he and other researchers said 
for example eht imagery will likely shine significant light on how gas spirals down into a black holes maw 
this accretion process which can lead to the generation of powerful jets of radiation is poorly understood loeb addition the shape of an event horizon can reveal whether a black hole is spinning said fiona harrison of the california institute of technology the principal investigator of nasas nuclear spectroscopic telescope array nustar inferred the spin of black holes indirectly harrison whos not part of the eht team told 
eht imagery provides a direct test which is very exciting she data revealed the black hole is spinning clockwise team members said today 
the project should also show how matter is distributed around a black hole and eht observations could eventually teach astronomers a great deal about how supermassive black holes shape the evolution of their host galaxies over long time scales harrison results also mesh well with those of the laser interferometer observatory ligo which has detected the ripples generated by mergers involving black holes just a few dozen times more massive than the varying across a factor of billion in mass known black holes are all consistent with a single description broderick said today 
black holes big and small are analogous in important ways 
what we learn from one type necessarily applies to the in case youre wondering about sagittarius a the eht team hopes to get imagery of that supermassive black hole soon doeleman said today 
the researchers looked at first and its a bit easier to resolve than sagittarius a because its less variable over short timescales he new perspective then theres the broader appeal of the newly released imagery how it speaks to those of us who arent astrophysicists 
the contributions in this arena could be significant eht team members and outside scientists said 
photos can change the way we think about ourselves and our place in the universe marrone noted citing the famous earthrise photo taken by apollo astronaut bill anders in december 
this image which gave the masses a glimpse of our planet as it really is a lonely outpost of life in an infinite sea of darkness is widely credited with helping to spur the environmental a black hole or its silhouette anyway is the stuff of science fiction harrison said 
and weve seen just the projects first few photos she added theyre only going to get better

rather it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area think of a star ten times more massive than the sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of new york city 
the result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing not even light can escape 
in recent years nasa instruments have painted a new picture of these strange objects that are to many the most fascinating objects in space 
intense flares thought to be caused by a black hole devouring a star 
video watch the video the idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape it has been around for centuries 
most famously black holes were predicted by einsteins theory of general relativity which showed that when a massive star dies it leaves behind a small dense remnant core 
if the cores mass is more than about three times the mass of the sun the equations showed the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole 
a video about black holes 
watch the video scientists cant directly observe black holes with telescopes that detect light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation 
we can however infer the presence of black holes and study them by detecting their effect on other matter nearby 
if a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter for example it will draw matter inward in a process known as accretion 
a similar process can occur if a normal star passes close to a black hole 
in this case the black hole can tear the star apart as it pulls it toward itself 
as the attracted matter accelerates and heats up it emits that radiate into space 
recent discoveries offer some tantalizing evidence that black holes have a dramatic influence on the neighborhoods around them emitting powerful gamma ray bursts devouring nearby stars and spurring the growth of new stars in some areas while stalling it in others 
one stars end is a black holes beginning most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion 
smaller stars become dense neutron stars which are not massive enough to trap light 
if the total mass of the star is large enough about three times the mass of the sun it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity 
however as the star collapses a strange thing occurs 
as the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the event horizon time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away 
when the surface reaches the event horizon time stands still and the star can collapse no more it is a frozen collapsing object 
astronomers have identified a candidate for the black hole 
video watch the video even bigger black holes can result from stellar collisions 
soon after its launch in december nasas swift telescope observed the powerful fleeting flashes of light known as gamma ray bursts 
chandra and nasas hubble space telescope later collected data from the events afterglow and together the observations led astronomers to conclude that the powerful explosions can result when a black hole and a neutron star collide producing another black hole 
babies and giants although the basic formation process is understood one perennial mystery in the science of black holes is that they appear to exist on two radically different size scales 
on the one end there are the countless black holes that are the remnants of massive stars 
peppered throughout the universe these stellar mass black holes are generally to times as massive as the sun 
astronomers spot them when another star draws near enough for some of the matter surrounding it to be snared by the black holes gravity churning out in the process 
most stellar black holes however are very difficult to detect 
judging from the number of stars large enough to produce such black holes however scientists estimate that there are as many as ten million to a billion such black holes in the milky way alone 
on the other end of the size spectrum are the giants known as supermassive black holes which are millions if not billions of times as massive as the sun 
astronomers believe that supermassive black holes lie at the center of virtually all large galaxies even our own milky way 
astronomers can detect them by watching for their effects on nearby stars and gas 
this chart shows the relative masses of cosmic objects 
read the full article historically astronomers have long believed that no black holes exist 
however recent evidence from chandra and hubble strengthens the case that black holes do exist 
one possible mechanism for the formation of supermassive black holes involves a chain reaction of collisions of stars in compact star clusters that results in the buildup of extremely massive stars which then collapse to form black holes 
the star clusters then sink to the center of the galaxy where the black holes merge to form a supermassive black hole

home news science astronomy hunt is on for gravity waves in by clara moskowitz published august artists impression of gravitational waves from two orbiting black holes 
image credit thorne caltech and carnahan nasa gsfc because black holes are impossible to see one of scientists best hopes to study them is to look for the ripples in called gravitational waves that they are thought to waves would be distortions propagating through space and time caused by violent events such as the collision of two black holes 
they were first predicted by einsteins general theory of relativity however scientists have yet to find could change when the latest version of a gravitational facility gets up and running 
the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ligo is actually a pair of observatories in louisiana and washington state that began operating in 
newly sensitized detectors are being added to advanced ligo detectors that are now being installed will see out through a substantial part of the universe said california institute of technology emeritus professor of physics kip thorne a leading proponent of ligo 
we expect to see black holes colliding at a rate of perhaps somewhere between once an hour and once a year 
bizarre black holes explained q a with physicist kip thorne each ligo facility involves two perpendicular arms in a giant stretching out about miles kilometers each 
each arm contains a mirror at either end with a beam of laser light continuously bouncing back and a gravitational wave were to pass through earth it would create a minute distortion in changing the distance between the two mirrors in one or both directions depending on how the wave was oriented 
scientists would measure this as a small difference in the time it takes the laser beams to travel the length of one arm compared with predicted ligos first discovery will come between and depends on how kind nature is and how rapid the commissioning or the debugging of the detectors is thorne told 
these are very very complex instruments 
it requires a lot of careful work by superb experimenters to bring them up to their design ligo does succeed in finding gravitational waves the ramifications could be 
not only would such a discovery confirm that these traveling warps exist in it would provide precious information about the nature of the black holes or other objects that created studying the shape of the gravitational waves their waveforms scientists could extract information about the objects that formed them 
a gravitational wave produced by a collision of two black holes for example would have a particular waveform according to theoretical will be able for each black hole pair to say what the masses of those black holes were what their spins were what the orbit was like as well as where these objects are in the universe where they are in the sky and how far away they are thorne said 
so theres a great deal of information in those waveforms both about relativitys predictions of warped and about whats going on in the universe with black clara moskowitz on twitter claramoskowitz or spacedotcom

home news science astronomy germany switches off black hole telescope on russian satellite halts space cooperation by tereza pultarova published march germany stopped all science cooperation with russia over its ukraine invasion but space station work continues 
the german erosita black hole telescope aboard the satellite was switched off as germany halted science cooperation with russia 
image credit german aerospace center a space telescope making the largest ever map of black holes in the universe has been switched off after germany halted all science cooperation with russia to protest that countrys invasion of ukraine 
the black telescope called erosita launched in from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan aboard the satellite 
the mission was jointly funded by the german aerospace center dlr and russias space agency roscosmos 
on wednesday a spokesperson for germanys max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics which built and operates erosita told in an email that the telescope was placed into safe mode during ground contact on saturday february move comes after germanys federal ministry of education and research announced on friday that all existing cooperation in science and research with russia would be immediately halted

in light of the aggression against ukraine the dlr executive board decided to stop cooperation on ongoing and planned projects the dlr said in the statement 
no new projects and initiatives with russian research institutions will take previously worked with russia on the bion m mission which sent mice and several lizard fish and snail species on a space trip in 
the two countries have also collaborated on development of robotic technologies for space exploration

home news science astronomy heres how scientists turned the world into a telescope to see a black hole by meghan bartels published april unsurprisingly its complicated 
tafreshi by it took eight telescopes across the planet a week of observations to produce the black hole image that stunned the world last week but it took scientists much longer to teach those instruments to work in the two years since the data behind that image was gathered the event horizon telescope partnership behind the groundbreaking observations has already expanded with more telescopes looking to join the fray soon 
each new instrument will sharpen scientists images of their quarry but each will also need to be outfitted carefully before it can join the the hardest work is already done dan marrone an astronomer at the university of arizona and a member of the event horizon telescope science team told 
for the most part the sites were adding now are just reimplementing the basic hardware that we know how to do well he eureka 
scientists photograph a black hole for the timebut the more telescopes the team can bring on board the sharper the final image is 
the challenge in doing this comes from the fact that none of these telescopes were for the event horizon telescope project 
theyre just instruments that happen to be what scientists call submillimeter telescopes which can sense the wavelength range the event horizon team members needed to tune to for their black hole the south pole telescope then the team needed to adapt a telescope designed to study the remnants of the big bang installing a special detector and an optics package 
all of which of course needed to withstand the extreme cold of event horizon telescope a array of eight radio telescopes forged through international collaboration captured this image of the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy and its shadow 
image credit eht collaboration and the instruments involved in the observations included both telescopes and multidish arrays 
that posed a particular challenge at the atacama large array alma high in the chilean desert where information from the different dishes needed to be compiled each of the instruments needed to be armed with an atomic clock so precise that it loses just second every million years 
the clocks time must be imprinted on all the telescopes observations so that when scientists combine data gathered by different telescopes the observations arent other crucial equipment the team needed to install at each instrument was a system that could keep up with the massive stream of data being produced gigabits every second of the observation period significantly more than other astronomy projects marrone said 
that required recording systems from commercial event horizon telescope team has already outfitted one newcomer this way the greenland telescope which came online for the programs observation campaign 
the addition posed its own challenges the telescope was originally built as a prototype for the dishes of alma then outfitted to withstand the cold shipped up to greenland and set up as part of the event horizon addition improved the teams observations of the northern part of stretching the arrays coverage northward 
another upcoming addition of the kitt peak telescope in arizona will strengthen the array in the opposite way partnering with the nearby submillimeter telescope to offer scientists some redundancy helping the team calibrate the observations 
if we could choose our array we would have two telescopes at every site marrone there are plenty of schemas for how to arrange a collection of networked instruments the team isnt really all that picky more telescopes will always help their resolution no matter where they are 
the earths terrain does a good job of randomizing where we can put them marrone said 
but theres no reason the event horizon telescope will always need to be 
currently there are no submillimeter telescopes in orbit but some team members are looking into proposing just such an instrument 
you dont need that much of a telescope marrone said 
its not quite cubesat scale but it aint jwst he added referencing the massive and james webb space telescope currently scheduled to launch in perhaps a contributor would address some of the mundane challenges that haunt marrone and his colleagues during their quest to see what cant be seen 
thats because the process requires gathering data multiplying it thousands of times and then clarifying a perfect sine wave rhythmic and symmetrical from it 
the number of days ive spent just trying to figure out what was making my sine wave wiggle it can be really painful marrone said 
the culprits can range from someone stepping on a cable or jumping near an atomic clock to the wind blowing too strongly or two pieces of metal touching each other when they this is a really weird job marrone said 
its all these stupid little issues that we always have to sort out to get this to work

direct image of a supermassive black hole at the core of messier animated simulation of a schwarzschild black hole with a galaxy passing behind 
around the time of alignment extreme gravitational lensing of the galaxy is observed 
a black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing including light or other electromagnetic waves has enough energy to escape its event horizon 
the theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole 
the boundary of no escape is called the event horizon 
although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity 
in many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body as it reflects no light 
moreover quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit hawking radiation with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass 
this temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes making it essentially impossible to observe directly 
objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the century by john michell and laplace 
in karl schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole 
david finkelstein in first published the interpretation of black hole as a region of space from which nothing can escape 
black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity it was not until the that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity 
the discovery of neutron stars by jocelyn bell burnell in sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality 
the first black hole known was cygnus identified by several researchers independently in 
black holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle 
after a black hole has formed it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings 
supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes 
there is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies 
the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light 
any matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction forming quasars some of the brightest objects in the universe 
stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shredded into streamers that shine very brightly before being swallowed 
if other stars are orbiting a black hole their orbits can determine the black holes mass and location 
such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars 
in this way astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems and established that the radio source known as sagittarius a at the core of the milky way galaxy contains a supermassive black hole of about million solar masses 
on february the ligo scientific collaboration and the virgo collaboration announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves representing the first observation of a black hole merger 
on april the first direct image of a black hole and its vicinity was published following observations made by the event horizon telescope eht in of the supermassive black hole in messier galactic centre 
as of update the nearest known body thought to be a black hole is around parsecs away see list of nearest black holes 
though only a couple dozen black holes have been found so far in the milky way there are thought to be hundreds of millions most of which are solitary and do not cause emission of radiation 
therefore they would only be detectable by gravitational lensing 
history simulated view of a black hole in front of the large magellanic cloud 
note the gravitational lensing effect which produces two enlarged but highly distorted views of the cloud 
across the top the milky way disk appears distorted into an arc 
the idea of a body so big that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by english astronomical pioneer and clergyman john michell in a letter published in november 
michells simplistic calculations assumed such a body might have the same density as the sun and concluded that one would form when a stars diameter exceeds the suns by a factor of and its surface escape velocity exceeds the usual speed of light 
michell referred to these bodies as dark stars 
he correctly noted that such supermassive but bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies 
scholars of the time were initially excited by the proposal that giant but invisible dark stars might be hiding in plain view but enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent in the early nineteenth century as if light were a wave rather than a particle it was unclear what if any influence gravity would have on escaping light waves 
modern physics discredits michells notion of a light ray shooting directly from the surface of a supermassive star being slowed down by the stars gravity stopping and then back to the stars surface

only a few months later karl schwarzschild found a solution to the einstein field equations that describes the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass 
a few months after schwarzschild johannes droste a student of hendrik lorentz independently gave the same solution for the point mass and wrote more extensively about its properties 
this solution had a peculiar behaviour at what is now called the schwarzschild radius where it became singular meaning that some of the terms in the einstein equations became infinite 
the nature of this surface was not quite understood at the time 
in arthur eddington showed that the singularity disappeared after a change of coordinates see coordinates although it took until for georges lemaître to realize that this meant the singularity at the schwarzschild radius was a coordinate singularity 
arthur eddington did however comment on the possibility of a star with mass compressed to the schwarzschild radius in a book noting that einsteins theory allows us to rule out overly large densities for visible stars like betelgeuse because a star of million km radius could not possibly have so high a density as the sun 
firstly the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape from it the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth 
secondly the red shift of the spectral lines would be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of existence 
thirdly the mass would produce so much curvature of the spacetime metric that space would close up around the star leaving us outside nowhere 
in subrahmanyan chandrasekhar calculated using special relativity that a body of matter above a certain limiting mass now called the chandrasekhar limit at has no stable solutions 
his arguments were opposed by many of his contemporaries like eddington and lev landau who argued that some yet unknown mechanism would stop the collapse 
they were partly correct a white dwarf slightly more massive than the chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a neutron star which is itself stable 
but in robert oppenheimer and others predicted that neutron stars above another limit the limit would collapse further for the reasons presented by chandrasekhar and concluded that no law of physics was likely to intervene and stop at least some stars from collapsing to black holes 
their original calculations based on the pauli exclusion principle gave it as subsequent consideration of repulsion mediated by the strong force raised the estimate to approximately to 
observations of the neutron star merger which is thought to have generated a black hole shortly afterward have refined the tov limit estimate to 
oppenheimer and his interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped 
this is a valid point of view for external observers but not for infalling observers 
because of this property the collapsed stars were called frozen stars because an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it to the schwarzschild radius 
golden age in david finkelstein identified the schwarzschild surface as an event horizon a perfect unidirectional membrane causal influences can cross it in only one direction 
this did not strictly contradict oppenheimers results but extended them to include the point of view of infalling observers 
finkelsteins solution extended the schwarzschild solution for the future of observers falling into a black hole 
a complete extension had already been found by martin kruskal who was urged to publish it 
these results came at the beginning of the golden age of general relativity which was marked by general relativity and black holes becoming mainstream subjects of research 
this process was helped by the discovery of pulsars by jocelyn bell burnell in which by were shown to be rapidly rotating neutron stars 
until that time neutron stars like black holes were regarded as just theoretical curiosities but the discovery of pulsars showed their physical relevance and spurred a further interest in all types of compact objects that might be formed by gravitational collapse 
citation needed in this period more general black hole solutions were found 
in roy kerr found the exact solution for a rotating black hole 
two years later ezra newman found the axisymmetric solution for a black hole that is both rotating and electrically charged 
through the work of werner israel brandon carter and david robinson the theorem emerged stating that a stationary black hole solution is completely described by the three parameters of the metric mass angular momentum and electric charge 
at first it was suspected that the strange features of the black hole solutions were pathological artifacts from the symmetry conditions imposed and that the singularities would not appear in generic situations 
this view was held in particular by vladimir belinsky isaak khalatnikov and evgeny lifshitz who tried to prove that no singularities appear in generic solutions 
however in the late roger penrose and stephen hawking used global techniques to prove that singularities appear generically 
for this work penrose received half of the nobel prize in physics hawking having died in 
based on observations in greenwich and toronto in the early cygnus a galactic source discovered in became the first astronomical object commonly accepted to be a black hole 
work by james bardeen jacob bekenstein carter and hawking in the early led to the formulation of black hole thermodynamics 
these laws describe the behaviour of a black hole in close analogy to the laws of thermodynamics by relating mass to energy area to entropy and surface gravity to temperature 
the analogy was completed when hawking in showed that quantum field theory implies that black holes should radiate like a black body with a temperature proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole predicting the effect now known as hawking radiation 
etymology john michell used the term dark star in a november letter to henry cavendish and in the early century physicists used the term gravitationally collapsed object 
science writer marcia bartusiak traces the term black hole to physicist robert dicke who in the early reportedly compared the phenomenon to the black hole of calcutta notorious as a prison where people entered but never left alive 
the term black hole was used in print by life and science news magazines in and by science journalist ann ewing in her article black holes in space dated january which was a report on a meeting of the american association for the advancement of science held in cleveland ohio 
in december a student reportedly suggested the phrase black hole at a lecture by john wheeler wheeler adopted the term for its brevity and advertising value and it quickly caught on leading some to credit wheeler with coining the phrase 
properties and structure simple illustration of a black holeartistic depiction of a black hole and its features the theorem postulates that once it achieves a stable condition after formation a black hole has only three independent physical properties mass electric charge and angular momentum the black hole is otherwise featureless 
if the conjecture is true any two black holes that share the same values for these properties or parameters are indistinguishable from one another 
the degree to which the conjecture is true for real black holes under the laws of modern physics is currently an unsolved problem 
these properties are special because they are visible from outside a black hole 
for example a charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged object 
similarly the total mass inside a sphere containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of gausss law through the adm mass far away from the black hole 
likewise the angular momentum or spin can be measured from far away using frame dragging by the gravitomagnetic field through for example the effect 
when an object falls into a black hole any information about the shape of the object or distribution of charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole and is lost to outside observers 
the behavior of the horizon in this situation is a dissipative system that is closely analogous to that of a conductive stretchy membrane with friction and electrical membrane paradigm 
this is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism which do not have any friction or resistivity at the microscopic level because they are 
because a black hole eventually achieves a stable state with only three parameters there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions the gravitational and electric fields of a black hole give very little information about what went in 
the information that is lost includes every quantity that can not be measured far away from the black hole horizon including approximately conserved quantum numbers such as the total baryon number and lepton number 
this behavior is so puzzling that it has been called the black hole information loss paradox 
gravitational time dilation around a black hole physical properties the simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum 
these black holes are often referred to as schwarzschild black holes after karl schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 
according to birkhoffs theorem it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric 
this means there is no observable difference at a distance between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass 
the popular notion of a black hole sucking in everything in its surroundings is therefore correct only near a black holes horizon far away the external gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass 
solutions describing more general black holes also exist 
charged black holes are described by the metric while the kerr metric describes a rotating black hole 
the most general stationary black hole solution known is the metric which describes a black hole with both charge and angular momentum 
while the mass of a black hole can take any positive value the charge and angular momentum are constrained by the mass 
the total electric charge q and the total angular momentum j are expected to satisfy the inequality q π ϵ c j g m g m for a black hole of mass black holes with the minimum possible mass satisfying this inequality are called extremal 
solutions of einsteins equations that violate this inequality exist but they do not possess an event horizon 
these solutions have naked singularities that can be observed from the outside and hence are deemed unphysical 
the cosmic censorship hypothesis rules out the formation of such singularities when they are created through the gravitational collapse of realistic matter 
this is supported by numerical simulations 
due to the relatively large strength of the electromagnetic force black holes forming from the collapse of stars are expected to retain the nearly neutral charge of the star 
rotation however is expected to be a universal feature of compact astrophysical objects 
the candidate binary source grs appears to have an angular momentum near the maximum allowed value 
that uncharged limit is j g m c c allowing definition of a dimensionless spin parameter such that c j g m 
note black hole classifications class supermassive black hole au black hole km rearth stellar black hole km micro black hole up to mmoon up to mm black holes are commonly classified according to their mass independent of angular momentum j 
the size of a black hole as determined by the radius of the event horizon or schwarzschild radius is proportional to the mass m through r s g m c m m k m s m km where rs is the schwarzschild radius and is the mass of the sun 
for a black hole with nonzero spin electric charge the radius is smaller note until an extremal black hole could have an event horizon close to r g m c 
event horizon main article event horizon far away from the black hole a particle can move in any direction as illustrated by the set of arrows 
it is restricted only by the speed of to the black hole spacetime starts to deform 
there are more paths going towards the black hole than paths moving away 
note inside of the event horizon all paths bring the particle closer to the centre of the black hole 
it is no longer possible for the particle to escape 
the defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event boundary in spacetime through which matter and light can pass only inward towards the mass of the black hole 
nothing not even light can escape from inside the event horizon 
the event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary information from that event can not reach an outside observer making it impossible to determine whether such an event occurred 
as predicted by general relativity the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass 
at the event horizon of a black hole this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that lead away from the black hole 
to a distant observer clocks near a black hole would appear to tick more slowly than those farther away from the black hole 
due to this effect known as gravitational time dilation an object falling into a black hole appears to slow as it approaches the event horizon taking an infinite time to reach it 
at the same time all processes on this object slow down from the viewpoint of a fixed outside observer causing any light emitted by the object to appear redder and dimmer an effect known as gravitational redshift 
eventually the falling object fades away until it can no longer be seen 
typically this process happens very rapidly with an object disappearing from view within less than a second 
on the other hand indestructible observers falling into a black hole do not notice any of these effects as they cross the event horizon 
according to their own clocks which appear to them to tick normally they cross the event horizon after a finite time without noting any singular behaviour in classical general relativity it is impossible to determine the location of the event horizon from local observations due to einsteins equivalence principle 
the topology of the event horizon of a black hole at equilibrium is always spherical 
note for static black holes the geometry of the event horizon is precisely spherical while for rotating black holes the event horizon is oblate 
singularity main article gravitational singularity at the centre of a black hole as described by general relativity may lie a gravitational singularity a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite 
for a black hole this region takes the shape of a single point for a rotating black hole it is smeared out to form a ring singularity that lies in the plane of rotation 
in both cases the singular region has zero volume 
it can also be shown that the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution 
the singular region can thus be thought of as having infinite density 
observers falling into a schwarzschild black hole and not charged can not avoid being carried into the singularity once they cross the event horizon 
they can prolong the experience by accelerating away to slow their descent but only up to a limit 
when they reach the singularity they are crushed to infinite density and their mass is added to the total of the black hole 
before that happens they will have been torn apart by the growing tidal forces in a process sometimes referred to as spaghettification or the noodle effect 
in the case of a charged or rotating kerr black hole it is possible to avoid the singularity 
extending these solutions as far as possible reveals the hypothetical possibility of exiting the black hole into a different spacetime with the black hole acting as a wormhole 
the possibility of traveling to another universe is however only theoretical since any perturbation would destroy this possibility 
it also appears to be possible to follow closed timelike curves returning to ones own past around the kerr singularity which leads to problems with causality like the grandfather paradox 
it is expected that none of these peculiar effects would survive in a proper quantum treatment of rotating and charged black holes 
the appearance of singularities in general relativity is commonly perceived as signaling the breakdown of the theory 
this breakdown however is expected it occurs in a situation where quantum effects should describe these actions due to the extremely high density and therefore particle interactions 
to date it has not been possible to combine quantum and gravitational effects into a single theory although there exist attempts to formulate such a theory of quantum gravity 
it is generally expected that such a theory will not feature any singularities 
photon sphere main article photon sphere the photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness in which photons that move on tangents to that sphere would be trapped in a circular orbit about the black hole 
for black holes the photon sphere has a radius times the schwarzschild radius 
their orbits would be dynamically unstable hence any small perturbation such as a particle of infalling matter would cause an instability that would grow over time either setting the photon on an outward trajectory causing it to escape the black hole or on an inward spiral where it would eventually cross the event horizon 
while light can still escape from the photon sphere any light that crosses the photon sphere on an inbound trajectory will be captured by the black hole 
hence any light that reaches an outside observer from the photon sphere must have been emitted by objects between the photon sphere and the event horizon 
for a kerr black hole the radius of the photon sphere depends on the spin parameter and on the details of the photon orbit which can be prograde the photon rotates in the same sense of the black hole spin or retrograde 
ergosphere main article ergosphere the ergosphere is a region outside of the event horizon where objects can not remain in place 
rotating black holes are surrounded by a region of spacetime in which it is impossible to stand still called the ergosphere 
this is the result of a process known as general relativity predicts that any rotating mass will tend to slightly drag along the spacetime immediately surrounding it 
any object near the rotating mass will tend to start moving in the direction of rotation 
for a rotating black hole this effect is so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction to just stand still 
the ergosphere of a black hole is a volume bounded by the black holes event horizon and the ergosurface which coincides with the event horizon at the poles but is at a much greater distance around the equator 
objects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere 
through the penrose process objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than they entered with 
the extra energy is taken from the rotational energy of the black hole 
thereby the rotation of the black hole slows down 
a variation of the penrose process in the presence of strong magnetic fields the process is considered a likely mechanism for the enormous luminosity and relativistic jets of quasars and other active galactic nuclei 
innermost stable circular orbit isco main article innermost stable circular orbit in newtonian gravity test particles can stably orbit at arbitrary distances from a central object 
in general relativity however there exists an innermost stable circular orbit often called the isco for which any infinitesimal inward perturbations to a circular orbit will lead to spiraling into the black hole and any outward perturbations will depending on the energy result in spiraling in stably orbiting between apastron and periastron or escaping to infinity 
the location of the isco depends on the spin of the black hole in the case of a schwarzschild black hole spin zero is r i s c o r s g m c isco s gm and decreases with increasing black hole spin for particles orbiting in the same direction as the spin 
formation and evolution given the bizarre character of black holes it was long questioned whether such objects could actually exist in nature or whether they were merely pathological solutions to einsteins equations 
einstein himself wrongly thought black holes would not form because he held that the angular momentum of collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some radius 
this led the general relativity community to dismiss all results to the contrary for many years 
however a minority of relativists continued to contend that black holes were physical objects and by the end of the they had persuaded the majority of researchers in the field that there is no obstacle to the formation of an event horizon 
simulation of two black holes colliding penrose demonstrated that once an event horizon forms general relativity without quantum mechanics requires that a singularity will form within 
shortly afterwards hawking showed that many cosmological solutions that describe the big bang have singularities without scalar fields or other exotic matter see singularity theorems 
clarification needed the kerr solution the theorem and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical properties of black holes were simple and comprehensible making them respectable subjects for research 
conventional black holes are formed by gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars but they can also in theory be formed by other processes 
gravitational collapse main article gravitational collapse gas cloud being ripped apart by black hole at the centre of the milky way observations from and are shown in blue green and red respectively 
gravitational collapse occurs when an objects internal pressure is insufficient to resist the objects own gravity 
for stars this usually occurs either because a star has too little fuel left to maintain its temperature through stellar nucleosynthesis or because a star that would have been stable receives extra matter in a way that does not raise its core temperature 
in either case the stars temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from collapsing under its own weight 
the collapse may be stopped by the degeneracy pressure of the stars constituents allowing the condensation of matter into an exotic denser state 
the result is one of the various types of compact star 
which type forms depends on the mass of the remnant of the original star left if the outer layers have been blown away for example in a type ii supernova 
the mass of the remnant the collapsed object that survives the explosion can be substantially less than that of the original star 
remnants exceeding are produced by stars that were over before the collapse 
if the mass of the remnant exceeds about the limit either because the original star was very heavy or because the remnant collected additional mass through accretion of matter even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is insufficient to stop the collapse 
no known mechanism except possibly quark degeneracy pressure see quark star is powerful enough to stop the implosion and the object will inevitably collapse to form a black hole 
artists impression of supermassive black hole seed the gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the formation of stellar mass black holes 
star formation in the early universe may have resulted in very massive stars which upon their collapse would have produced black holes of up to 
these black holes could be the seeds of the supermassive black holes found in the centres of most galaxies 
it has further been suggested that massive black holes with typical masses of could have formed from the direct collapse of gas clouds in the young universe 
these massive objects have been proposed as the seeds that eventually formed the earliest quasars observed already at redshift z 
some candidates for such objects have been found in observations of the young universe 
while most of the energy released during gravitational collapse is emitted very quickly an outside observer does not actually see the end of this process 
even though the collapse takes a finite amount of time from the reference frame of infalling matter a distant observer would see the infalling material slow and halt just above the event horizon due to gravitational time dilation 
light from the collapsing material takes longer and longer to reach the observer with the light emitted just before the event horizon forms delayed an infinite amount of time 
thus the external observer never sees the formation of the event horizon instead the collapsing material seems to become dimmer and increasingly eventually fading away 
primordial black holes and the big bang gravitational collapse requires great density 
in the current epoch of the universe these high densities are found only in stars but in the early universe shortly after the big bang densities were much greater possibly allowing for the creation of black holes 
high density alone is not enough to allow black hole formation since a uniform mass distribution will not allow the mass to bunch up 
in order for primordial black holes to have formed in such a dense medium there must have been initial density perturbations that could then grow under their own gravity 
different models for the early universe vary widely in their predictions of the scale of these fluctuations 
various models predict the creation of primordial black holes ranging in size from a planck mass m p ℏ c g p kg to hundreds of thousands of solar masses 
despite the early universe being extremely dense it did not into a black hole during the big bang since the expansion rate was greater than the attraction 
following inflation theory there was a net repulsive gravitation in the beginning until the end of inflation 
since then the hubble flow was slowed by the energy density of the universe 
models for the gravitational collapse of objects of relatively constant size such as stars do not necessarily apply in the same way to rapidly expanding space such as the big bang 
collisions simulated event in the cms detector a collision in which a micro black hole may be created gravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes 
in principle black holes could be formed in collisions that achieve sufficient density 
as of no such events have been detected either directly or indirectly as a deficiency of the mass balance in particle accelerator experiments 
this suggests that there must be a lower limit for the mass of black holes 
theoretically this boundary is expected to lie around the planck mass where quantum effects are expected to invalidate the predictions of general relativity 
this would put the creation of black holes firmly out of reach of any process occurring on or near the earth 
however certain developments in quantum gravity suggest that the minimum black hole mass could be much lower some braneworld scenarios for example put the boundary as low as 
this would make it conceivable for micro black holes to be created in the collisions that occur when cosmic rays hit the earths atmosphere or possibly in the large hadron collider at cern 
these theories are very speculative and the creation of black holes in these processes is deemed unlikely by many specialists 
even if micro black holes could be formed it is expected that they would evaporate in about seconds posing no threat to the earth 
growth once a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing additional matter 
any black hole will continually absorb gas and interstellar dust from its surroundings 
this growth process is one possible way through which some supermassive black holes may have been formed although the formation of supermassive black holes is still an open field of research 
a similar process has been suggested for the formation of black holes found in globular clusters 
black holes can also merge with other objects such as stars or even other black holes 
this is thought to have been important especially in the early growth of supermassive black holes which could have formed from the aggregation of many smaller objects 
the process has also been proposed as the origin of some black holes 
evaporation main article hawking radiation in hawking predicted that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiation at a temperature this effect has become known as hawking radiation 
by applying quantum field theory to a static black hole background he determined that a black hole should emit particles that display a perfect black body spectrum 
since hawkings publication many others have verified the result through various approaches 
if hawkings theory of black hole radiation is correct then black holes are expected to shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles 
the temperature of this thermal spectrum hawking temperature is proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole which for a schwarzschild black hole is inversely proportional to the mass 
hence large black holes emit less radiation than small black holes 
a stellar black hole of has a hawking temperature of nanokelvins 
this is far less than the k temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation 
or larger black holes receive more mass from the cosmic microwave background than they emit through hawking radiation and thus will grow instead of shrinking 
to have a hawking temperature larger than k and be able to evaporate a black hole would need a mass less than the moon 
such a black hole would have a diameter of less than a tenth of a millimeter 
if a black hole is very small the radiation effects are expected to become very strong 
a black hole with the mass of a car would have a diameter of about m and take a nanosecond to evaporate during which time it would briefly have a luminosity of more than times that of the sun 
black holes are expected to evaporate even faster for example a black hole of mass would take less than seconds to evaporate completely 
for such a small black hole quantum gravity effects are expected to play an important role and could hypothetically make such a small black hole stable although current developments in quantum gravity do not indicate this is the case 
the hawking radiation for an astrophysical black hole is predicted to be very weak and would thus be exceedingly difficult to detect from earth 
a possible exception however is the burst of gamma rays emitted in the last stage of the evaporation of primordial black holes 
searches for such flashes have proven unsuccessful and provide stringent limits on the possibility of existence of low mass primordial black holes 
nasas fermi space telescope launched in will continue the search for these flashes 
if black holes evaporate via hawking radiation a solar mass black hole will evaporate beginning once the temperature of the cosmic microwave background drops below that of the black hole over a period of years 
a supermassive black hole with a mass of will evaporate in around years 
some monster black holes in the universe are predicted to continue to grow up to perhaps during the collapse of superclusters of galaxies 
even these would evaporate over a timescale of up to years 
observational evidence by nature black holes do not themselves emit any electromagnetic radiation other than the hypothetical hawking radiation so astrophysicists searching for black holes must generally rely on indirect observations 
for example a black holes existence can sometimes be inferred by observing its gravitational influence on its surroundings 
on april an image was released of a black hole which is seen magnified because the light paths near the event horizon are highly bent 
the dark shadow in the middle results from light paths absorbed by the black hole 
the image is in false color as the detected light halo in this image is not in the visible spectrum but radio waves 
artist s impression of the closest black hole to earth and its companion star this artists impression depicts the paths of photons in the vicinity of a black hole 
the gravitational bending and capture of light by the event horizon is the cause of the shadow captured by the event horizon telescope 
the event horizon telescope eht is an active program that directly observes the immediate environment of black holes event horizons such as the black hole at the centre of the milky way 
in april eht began observing the black hole at the centre of messier 
in all eight radio observatories on six mountains and four continents observed the galaxy in virgo on and off for days in april to provide the data yielding the image in april 
after two years of data processing eht released the first direct image of a black hole specifically the supermassive black hole that lies in the centre of the aforementioned galaxy 
what is visible is not the black shows as black because of the loss of all light within this dark region 
instead it is the gases at the edge of the event horizon displayed as orange or red that define the black hole 
on may the eht released the first image of sagittarius a the supermassive black hole at the centre of the milky way galaxy 
the published image displayed the same structure and circular shadow as seen in the black hole and the image was created using the same techniques as for the black hole 
however the imaging process for sagittarius a which is more than a thousand times smaller and less massive than was significantly more complex because of the instability of its surroundings 
the image of sagittarius a was also partially blurred by turbulent plasma on the way to the galactic centre an effect which prevents resolution of the image at longer wavelengths 
the brightening of this material in the bottom half of the processed eht image is thought to be caused by doppler beaming whereby material approaching the viewer at relativistic speeds is perceived as brighter than material moving away 
in the case of a black hole this phenomenon implies that the visible material is rotating at relativistic speeds mph the only speeds at which it is possible to centrifugally balance the immense gravitational attraction of the singularity and thereby remain in orbit above the event horizon 
this configuration of bright material implies that the eht observed from a perspective catching the black holes accretion disc nearly as the whole system rotated clockwise 
however the extreme gravitational lensing associated with black holes produces the illusion of a perspective that sees the accretion disc from above 
in reality most of the ring in the eht image was created when the light emitted by the far side of the accretion disc bent around the black holes gravity well and escaped meaning that most of the possible perspectives on can see the entire disc even that directly behind the shadow 
in the eht detected magnetic fields just outside the event horizon of sagittarius a and even discerned some of their properties 
the field lines that pass through the accretion disc were a complex mixture of ordered and tangled 
theoretical studies of black holes had predicted the existence of magnetic fields 
predicted appearance of a black hole with toroidal ring of ionised matter such as has been proposed as a model for sagittarius a 
the asymmetry is due to the doppler effect resulting from the enormous orbital speed needed for centrifugal balance of the powerful gravitational attraction of the hole 
detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes on september the ligo gravitational wave observatory made the successful direct observation of gravitational waves 
the signal was consistent with theoretical predictions for the gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes one with about solar masses and the other around solar masses 
this observation provides the most concrete evidence for the existence of black holes to date 
for instance the gravitational wave signal suggests that the separation of the two objects before the merger was just km or roughly four times the schwarzschild radius corresponding to the inferred masses 
the objects must therefore have been extremely compact leaving black holes as the most plausible interpretation 
more importantly the signal observed by ligo also included the start of the ringdown the signal produced as the newly formed compact object settles down to a stationary state 
arguably the ringdown is the most direct way of observing a black hole 
from the ligo signal it is possible to extract the frequency and damping time of the dominant mode of the ringdown 
from these it is possible to infer the mass and angular momentum of the final object which match independent predictions from numerical simulations of the merger 
the frequency and decay time of the dominant mode are determined by the geometry of the photon sphere 
hence observation of this mode confirms the presence of a photon sphere however it can not exclude possible exotic alternatives to black holes that are compact enough to have a photon sphere 
the observation also provides the first observational evidence for the existence of black hole binaries 
furthermore it is the first observational evidence of black holes weighing solar masses or more 
since then many more gravitational wave events have been observed 
proper motions of stars orbiting sagittarius a the proper motions of stars near the centre of our own milky way provide strong observational evidence that these stars are orbiting a supermassive black hole 
since astronomers have tracked the motions of stars orbiting an invisible object coincident with the radio source sagittarius a 
by fitting their motions to keplerian orbits the astronomers were able to infer in that a object must be contained in a volume with a radius of to cause the motions of those stars 
since then one of the completed a full orbit 
from the orbital data astronomers were able to refine the calculations of the mass to and a radius of less than for the object causing the orbital motion of those stars 
the upper limit on the objects size is still too large to test whether it is smaller than its schwarzschild radius nevertheless these observations strongly suggest that the central object is a supermassive black hole as there are no other plausible scenarios for confining so much invisible mass into such a small volume 
additionally there is some observational evidence that this object might possess an event horizon a feature unique to black holes 
accretion of matter see also accretion disk black hole with corona source artists concept due to conservation of angular momentum gas falling into the gravitational well created by a massive object will typically form a structure around the object 
artists impressions such as the accompanying representation of a black hole with corona commonly depict the black hole as if it were a body hiding the part of the disk just behind it but in reality gravitational lensing would greatly distort the image of the accretion disk 
nasa simulated view from outside the horizon of a schwarzschild black hole lit by a thin accretion disk 
within such a disk friction would cause angular momentum to be transported outward allowing matter to fall farther inward thus releasing potential energy and increasing the temperature of the gas 
blurring of near black hole nustar august when the accreting object is a neutron star or a black hole the gas in the inner accretion disk orbits at very high speeds because of its proximity to the compact object 
the resulting friction is so significant that it heats the inner disk to temperatures at which it emits vast amounts of electromagnetic radiation mainly 
these bright sources may be detected by telescopes 
this process of accretion is one of the most efficient processes known up to of the rest mass of the accreted material can be emitted as radiation 
in nuclear fusion only about of the rest mass will be emitted as energy 
in many cases accretion disks are accompanied by relativistic jets that are emitted along the poles which carry away much of the energy 
the mechanism for the creation of these jets is currently not well understood in part due to insufficient data 
as such many of the universes more energetic phenomena have been attributed to the accretion of matter on black holes 
in particular active galactic nuclei and quasars are believed to be the accretion disks of supermassive black holes 
similarly binaries are generally accepted to be binary star systems in which one of the two stars is a compact object accreting matter from its companion 
it has also been suggested that some ultraluminous sources may be the accretion disks of black holes 
in november the first direct observation of a quasar accretion disk around a supermassive black hole was reported 
binaries see also binary computer simulation of a star being consumed by a black hole 
the blue dot indicates the location of the black hole 
this animation compares the heartbeats of grs and igr two black holes that ingest gas from companion stars 
a chandra observatory image of cygnus which was the first strong black hole candidate discovered binaries are binary star systems that emit a majority of their radiation in the part of the spectrum 
these emissions are generally thought to result when one of the stars compact object accretes matter from another regular star 
the presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides an opportunity for studying the central object and to determine if it might be a black hole 
if such a system emits signals that can be directly traced back to the compact object it can not be a black hole 
the absence of such a signal does however not exclude the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star 
by studying the companion star it is often possible to obtain the orbital parameters of the system and to obtain an estimate for the mass of the compact object 
if this is much larger than the limit the maximum mass a star can have without collapsing then the object can not be a neutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole 
the first strong candidate for a black hole cygnus was discovered in this way by charles thomas bolton louise webster and paul murdin in 
some doubt however remained due to the uncertainties that result from the companion star being much heavier than the candidate black hole 
currently better candidates for black holes are found in a class of binaries called soft transients 
in this class of system the companion star is of relatively low mass allowing for more accurate estimates of the black hole mass 
moreover these systems actively emit for only several months once every years 
during the period of low emission called quiescence the accretion disk is extremely faint allowing detailed observation of the companion star during this period 
one of the best such candidates is cygni 
oscillations main article oscillation the emissions from accretion disks sometimes flicker at certain frequencies 
these signals are called oscillations and are thought to be caused by material moving along the inner edge of the accretion disk the innermost stable circular orbit 
as such their frequency is linked to the mass of the compact object 
they can thus be used as an alternative way to determine the mass of candidate black holes 
galactic nuclei see also active galactic nucleus magnetic waves called alfvén flow from the base of black hole jets 
astronomers use the term active galaxy to describe galaxies with unusual characteristics such as unusual spectral line emission and very strong radio emission 
theoretical and observational studies have shown that the activity in these active galactic nuclei agn may be explained by the presence of supermassive black holes which can be millions of times more massive than stellar ones 
the models of these agn consist of a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times more massive than the sun a disk of interstellar gas and dust called an accretion disk and two jets perpendicular to the accretion disk 
detection of unusually bright flare from sagittarius a a black hole in the centre of the milky way galaxy on january although supermassive black holes are expected to be found in most agn only some galaxies nuclei have been more carefully studied in attempts to both identify and measure the actual masses of the central supermassive black hole candidates 
some of the most notable galaxies with supermassive black hole candidates include the andromeda galaxy ngc ngc ngc ngc ngc oj apm and the sombrero galaxy 
it is now widely accepted that the centre of nearly every galaxy not just active ones contains a supermassive black hole 
the close observational correlation between the mass of this hole and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxys bulge known as the relation strongly suggests a connection between the formation of the black hole and that of the galaxy itself 
simulation of gas cloud after close approach to the black hole at the centre of the milky way 
microlensing another way the black hole nature of an object may be tested is through observation of effects caused by a strong gravitational field in their vicinity 
one such effect is gravitational lensing the deformation of spacetime around a massive object causes light rays to be deflected such as light passing through an optic lens 
observations have been made of weak gravitational lensing in which light rays are deflected by only a few arcseconds 
microlensing occurs when the sources are unresolved and the observer sees a small brightening 
in january astronomers reported the first possible detection of a microlensing event from an isolated black hole 
another possibility for observing gravitational lensing by a black hole would be to observe stars orbiting the black hole 
there are several candidates for such an observation in orbit around sagittarius a 
alternatives see also exotic star the evidence for stellar black holes strongly relies on the existence of an upper limit for the mass of a neutron star 
the size of this limit heavily depends on the assumptions made about the properties of dense matter 
new exotic phases of matter could push up this bound 
a phase of free quarks at high density might allow the existence of dense quark stars and some supersymmetric models predict the existence of q stars 
some extensions of the standard model posit the existence of preons as fundamental building blocks of quarks and leptons which could hypothetically form preon stars 
these hypothetical models could potentially explain a number of observations of stellar black hole candidates 
however it can be shown from arguments in general relativity that any such object will have a maximum mass 
since the average density of a black hole inside its schwarzschild radius is inversely proportional to the square of its mass supermassive black holes are much less dense than stellar black holes the average density of a black hole is comparable to that of water 
consequently the physics of matter forming a supermassive black hole is much better understood and the possible alternative explanations for supermassive black hole observations are much more mundane 
for example a supermassive black hole could be modelled by a large cluster of very dark objects 
however such alternatives are typically not stable enough to explain the supermassive black hole candidates 
the evidence for the existence of stellar and supermassive black holes implies that in order for black holes to not form general relativity must fail as a theory of gravity perhaps due to the onset of quantum mechanical corrections 
a much anticipated feature of a theory of quantum gravity is that it will not feature singularities or event horizons and thus black holes would not be real artifacts 
for example in the fuzzball model based on string theory the individual states of a black hole solution do not generally have an event horizon or singularity but for a observer the statistical average of such states appears just as an ordinary black hole as deduced from general relativity 
a few theoretical objects have been conjectured to match observations of astronomical black hole candidates identically or but which function via a different mechanism 
these include the gravastar the black star and the star 
open questions entropy and thermodynamics further information black hole thermodynamics and bekenstein bound s athe formula for the entropy s of a black hole which depends on the area of the black hole a 
the constants are the speed of light c the boltzmann constant k newtons constant g and the reduced planck constant ħ 
in planck units this reduces to s 
in hawking showed under general conditions note that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease even if they collide and merge 
this result now known as the second law of black hole mechanics is remarkably similar to the second law of thermodynamics which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease 
as with classical objects at absolute zero temperature it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy 
if this were the case the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by matter entering a black hole resulting in a decrease in the total entropy of the universe 
therefore bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy and that it should be proportional to its horizon area 
the link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by hawkings discovery in that quantum field theory predicts that a black hole radiates blackbody radiation at a constant temperature 
this seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink 
the radiation however also carries away entropy and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in planck units is in fact always increasing 
this allows the formulation of the first law of black hole mechanics as an analogue of the first law of thermodynamics with the mass acting as energy the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy 
one puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume since entropy is normally an extensive quantity that scales linearly with the volume of the system 
this odd property led gerard t hooft and leonard susskind to propose the holographic principle which suggests that anything that happens in a volume of spacetime can be described by data on the boundary of that volume 
although general relativity can be used to perform a calculation of black hole entropy this situation is theoretically unsatisfying 
in statistical mechanics entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities such as mass charge pressure etc 
without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity one can not perform such a computation for black holes 
some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity 
in andrew strominger and cumrun vafa showed that counting the microstates of a specific supersymmetric black hole in string theory reproduced the entropy 
since then similar results have been reported for different black holes both in string theory and in other approaches to quantum gravity like loop quantum gravity 
another promising approach is constituted by treating gravity as an effective field theory 
one first computes the quantum gravitational corrections to the radius of the event horizon of the black hole then integrates over it to find the quantum gravitational corrections to the entropy as given by the wald formula 
the method was applied for schwarzschild black holes by calmet and kuipers then successfully generalised for charged black holes by campos delgado 
information loss paradox main article black hole information paradox unsolved problem in physics is physical information lost in black holes 
more unsolved problems in physics because a black hole has only a few internal parameters most of the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole is lost 
regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole it appears that only information concerning the total mass charge and angular momentum are conserved 
as long as black holes were thought to persist forever this information loss is not that problematic as the information can be thought of as existing inside the black hole inaccessible from the outside but represented on the event horizon in accordance with the holographic principle 
however black holes slowly evaporate by emitting hawking radiation 
this radiation does not appear to carry any additional information about the matter that formed the black hole meaning that this information appears to be gone forever 
the question whether information is truly lost in black holes the black hole information paradox has divided the theoretical physics community see bet 
in quantum mechanics loss of information corresponds to the violation of a property called unitarity and it has been argued that loss of unitarity would also imply violation of conservation of energy though this has also been disputed 
over recent years evidence has been building that indeed information and unitarity are preserved in a full quantum gravitational treatment of the problem 
one attempt to resolve the black hole information paradox is known as black hole complementarity 
in the firewall paradox was introduced with the goal of demonstrating that black hole complementarity fails to solve the information paradox 
according to quantum field theory in curved spacetime a single emission of hawking radiation involves two mutually entangled particles 
the outgoing particle escapes and is emitted as a quantum of hawking radiation the infalling particle is swallowed by the black hole 
assume a black hole formed a finite time in the past and will fully evaporate away in some finite time in the future 
then it will emit only a finite amount of information encoded within its hawking radiation 
according to research by physicists like don page and leonard susskind there will eventually be a time by which an outgoing particle must be entangled with all the hawking radiation the black hole has previously emitted 
this seemingly creates a paradox a principle called monogamy of entanglement requires that like any quantum system the outgoing particle can not be fully entangled with two other systems at the same time yet here the outgoing particle appears to be entangled both with the infalling particle and independently with past hawking radiation 
in order to resolve this contradiction physicists may eventually be forced to give up one of three principles einsteins equivalence principle unitarity or local quantum field theory 
one possible solution which violates the equivalence principle is that a firewall destroys incoming particles at the event horizon 
in general these assumptions should be abandoned remains a topic of debate

the set of possible paths or more accurately the future light cone containing all possible world lines in this diagram the light cone is represented by the region bounded by arrows representing light ray world lines is tilted in this way in coordinates the diagram is a cartoon version of an coordinate diagram but in other coordinates the light cones are not tilted in this way for example in schwarzschild coordinates they narrow without tilting as one approaches the event horizon and in coordinates the light cones do not change shape or orientation at all 
this is true only for spacetimes 
in higher dimensions more complicated horizon topologies like a black ring are possible 
in particular he assumed that all matter satisfies the weak energy condition

the first conclusion was the newtonian version of light not escaping the second was a relativistic description and the third was typical eddingtonian hyperbole when a star is as small as the critical circumference the curvature is strong but not infinite and space is definitely not wrapped around the star 
eddington may have known this but his description made a good story and it captured in a whimsical way the spirit of schwarzschilds spacetime curvature

home news science astronomy magnetic fields may muzzle milky ways monster black hole by nola taylor tillman published june magnetic fields may keep the milky ways supermassive black hole quiet 
in this image streamlines showing magnetic fields overlay a color image of the dusty ring surrounding the milky ways supermassive black hole 
warm material falling toward the black hole creates a structure with the black hole lying near the intersection of the two arms 
image credit dust and magnetic fields star field image space telescope magnetic forces may explain why the supermassive black hole at the heart of the milky way is so much quieter than its counterparts in other galaxies 
new observations taken by nasas stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy sofia mission reveal unprecedented information about the strong magnetic field lines at the center of the strong gravitational pull of the milky ways central black hole which is known as sagittarius a dominates the heart of the galaxy 
in general as material falls into black holes the dark giants emit radiation that reveals their presence 
compared to black holes seen in other galaxies however the milky ways heart is relatively quiet emitting far less radiation than expected 
understanding how black holes interact with their magnetic fields can help scientists understand the difference between active and quiet black images black holes of the universewhether they exist around refrigerator magnets or black holes magnetic fields are invisible 
to study the ones connected to sagittarius a researchers relied on sofia which is a modified boeing aircraft 
specifically they employed sofias newest instrument the airborne wideband to track polarized light emitted by dust particles 
because dust grains line up perpendicular to magnetic fields astronomers were able to map the shape and infer the strength of the magnetic field around the black hole 
combining the new map with and images of sagittarius a revealed the direction of the magnetic field 
while some of the material from the surrounding ring of gas and dust is falling toward the black hole the magnetic field also directs material away from the hungry giant researchers spiral shape of the magnetic field channels the gas into an orbit around the black hole principal investigator darren dowell of nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena california said in a statement 
this could explain why our black hole is quiet while others are active added dowell lead author of a new study reporting the sofia a is the closest supermassive black hole to the sun and therefore provides a good opportunity to learn how the mysterious giants is one of the first instances where we can really see how magnetic fields and interstellar matter interact with each other said study joan schmelz an astrophysicist at nasa ames research center in california

rather it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area think of a star ten times more massive than the sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of new york city 
the result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing not even light can escape 
in recent years nasa instruments have painted a new picture of these strange objects that are to many the most fascinating objects in space 
intense flares thought to be caused by a black hole devouring a star 
video watch the video the idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape it has been around for centuries 
most famously black holes were predicted by einsteins theory of general relativity which showed that when a massive star dies it leaves behind a small dense remnant core 
if the cores mass is more than about three times the mass of the sun the equations showed the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole 
a video about black holes 
watch the video scientists cant directly observe black holes with telescopes that detect light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation 
we can however infer the presence of black holes and study them by detecting their effect on other matter nearby 
if a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter for example it will draw matter inward in a process known as accretion 
a similar process can occur if a normal star passes close to a black hole 
in this case the black hole can tear the star apart as it pulls it toward itself 
as the attracted matter accelerates and heats up it emits that radiate into space 
recent discoveries offer some tantalizing evidence that black holes have a dramatic influence on the neighborhoods around them emitting powerful gamma ray bursts devouring nearby stars and spurring the growth of new stars in some areas while stalling it in others 
one stars end is a black holes beginning most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion 
smaller stars become dense neutron stars which are not massive enough to trap light 
if the total mass of the star is large enough about three times the mass of the sun it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity 
however as the star collapses a strange thing occurs 
as the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the event horizon time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away 
when the surface reaches the event horizon time stands still and the star can collapse no more it is a frozen collapsing object 
astronomers have identified a candidate for the black hole 
video watch the video even bigger black holes can result from stellar collisions 
soon after its launch in december nasas swift telescope observed the powerful fleeting flashes of light known as gamma ray bursts 
chandra and nasas hubble space telescope later collected data from the events afterglow and together the observations led astronomers to conclude that the powerful explosions can result when a black hole and a neutron star collide producing another black hole 
babies and giants although the basic formation process is understood one perennial mystery in the science of black holes is that they appear to exist on two radically different size scales 
on the one end there are the countless black holes that are the remnants of massive stars 
peppered throughout the universe these stellar mass black holes are generally to times as massive as the sun 
astronomers spot them when another star draws near enough for some of the matter surrounding it to be snared by the black holes gravity churning out in the process 
most stellar black holes however are very difficult to detect 
judging from the number of stars large enough to produce such black holes however scientists estimate that there are as many as ten million to a billion such black holes in the milky way alone 
on the other end of the size spectrum are the giants known as supermassive black holes which are millions if not billions of times as massive as the sun 
astronomers believe that supermassive black holes lie at the center of virtually all large galaxies even our own milky way 
astronomers can detect them by watching for their effects on nearby stars and gas 
this chart shows the relative masses of cosmic objects 
read the full article historically astronomers have long believed that no black holes exist 
however recent evidence from chandra and hubble strengthens the case that black holes do exist 
one possible mechanism for the formation of supermassive black holes involves a chain reaction of collisions of stars in compact star clusters that results in the buildup of extremely massive stars which then collapse to form black holes 
the star clusters then sink to the center of the galaxy where the black holes merge to form a supermassive black hole

here s how it works 
home news science astronomy what is the black hole information paradox 
by paul sutter published june an artists depiction of a black hole 
image credit paul sutter is an astrophysicist at the ohio state university host of ask a spaceman and space radio and author of your place in the universe 
sutter contributed this article to expert voices insights 
the universe really likes its information 
it doesnt like to create new information and it doesnt like to destroy any of its existing fact like is far too weak of a word 
as far as we can tell and weve worked really really hard to check information is neither created nor destroyed information throughout the universe simply in black holes 
scientists photograph a black hole for the time information overload first we need to decide what we mean by information and why it ought to be preserved 
physics is ruled by determinism we can use the laws of physics to predict the future behavior of a system 
thats kind of the entire point of physics 
whether its a particle sitting in a box or a complex chemical reaction or the whole entire universe our knowledge of physics allows us to make firm reliable predictions that take our knowledge from the present into the that same technique allows us to dig into the past 
if we know all there is to know about a system then the same laws of physics that extend into the future also extend into the past we can run the clock forward or backward seeing how that system has behaved or will behave with equal this reversibility that allows us to make the leap that information is preserved 
if i know everything there is to know about a system the positions and velocities of all the particles their spins and electric charges and all the other stuff then the laws of physics tell me how all those particles will behave past and future 
thus the raw information of the system everything there is to know about it is preserved across time it just gets rearranged not created or bye black holes at first glance black holes seem to treat information innocently enough 
stuff falls into black holes along with their information 
from the point of view of an external observer us watching safely from a distance nothing ever falls into a black hole it just gets pasted onto the surface of course it s a little more complicated than that but that s enough to understand the current dilemma 
that situation isnt that big of a deal for information which is neither created nor when the black hole evaporates which creates a tiny problem 
as stephen hawking first discovered in the black holes arent entirely black 
they do glow just a tiny tiny bit 
whats more this conveniently named hawking radiation is completely thermal 
it s just random heat just like your body gives means that the amount and temperature of the radiation emitted depends only on the mass spin and charge of the black hole 
nothing else no matter what you throw into a black hole from books to cats to spaceships its hawking radiation will stay the is fine and dandy the information on the surface is still there minding its own business 
but as the black hole produces hawking radiation it loses energy which means it loses mass which means it eventually disappears along with all the information it was if the information didnt leak out with the hawking radiation and the black hole goes away what happened to all the information hence physics to the rescue we dont have a resolution to the black hole information paradox but that hasnt stopped theorists from dreaming up a host of potential solutions over the for example information is preserved after all 
although this may seem like a simple statement it involves rewriting almost all known physics 
and black holes are the only places where weve run into trouble with this whole thing so is it really worth reinventing all our physical knowledge just to accommodate this one special case 
and yet weve had to rewrite all of physics before so its not like it would be the first time and black holes are very compelling maybe hawking radiation isnt all its cracked up to be 
maybe somehow the information stuck to the surface of the black hole does end up threading its way into the emitted radiation 
maybe hawkings original analysis was too simple and by careful observations of the radiation we could painstakingly reconstruct the books and cats and spaceships that fell in 
while this would rescue all of known physics nobody has been able to find a satisfactory way to actually you know make this information doesnt get stuck to the surface but instead is left behind in some sort of crunchy nugget just as the black hole finishes evaporating 
that sounds lovely but again we have little to no idea of how this would actually work 
or maybe its something even wilder like the information getting funneled into another universe or looping back in exciting about this paradox is that all of the potential answers lead to new physics 
no matter what if we resolve the paradox well do so by learning something new about the universe 
huge questions the black hole image didnt answer all your questions about the new black hole image answered black hole photos could get even clearer with telescopes learn more by listening to the episode what is the black hole information paradox

here s how it works 
home references supermassive black holes theory characteristics and formation by andrew maycontributions from scott dutfield published march a look at the supermassive black holes that lurk at the heart of most galaxies 
an artist s impression of a quasar powered by a supermassive black hole 
kornmesser jump to size examples at the center of the galaxy formation additional resources bibliography only a handful of supermassive black holes have been confirmed by scientists but the universe could be filled with billions of these gravitational giants 
theoretically if you compress a sufficient amount of matter into a small enough space it will create such a powerful gravitational field that nothing not even light can escape from it 
that s the basic idea behind black holes and it s so bizarre that for many years people thought they couldn t possibly exist in reality according to university of texas in austin today we know the universe is filled with them perhaps as many as one for every ten visible stars according to live science 
a few of those black holes are truly enormous with masses millions of times greater than the sun 
here we take a closer look at the strange world of supermassive black big are supermassive black holes it s impossible to observe a black hole directly because as their name suggests they don t emit any light or other radiation 
but they can be detected via their gravitational effect on visible stars in their neighbourhood which orbit around the black hole much faster than they would around a normal object of similar size 
by measuring the speed of stars close to the black hole astronomers can estimate its mass 
that s how they know for example that the black hole at the center of our own galaxy has a mass around four million times that of the sun according to nasa big as that sounds it s really quite tiny compared to the largest supermassive black holes that have been measured some of which approach billion solar masses supermassive black hole examplesimage of image credit scott by leo i dwarf galaxy although this tiny galaxy is only about million solar masses in total its central black hole is proportionately huge at around million solar masses 
image credit optical et al 
centaurus a this huge elliptical galaxy a cosmic neighbour at just million is a powerful radio emitter thanks to the million solar mass black hole at its center 
image credit atlas team 
durham ngc the product of two merging galaxies ngc still retains two separate supermassive black holes of and million solar masses just apart near its center 
image credit nasa esa postman stsci lauer noao tucson clash team abell this cluster of galaxies is estimated to have a black hole of up to billion solar masses near its center 
frustratingly its exact location continues to elude detection 
black holes at the center of galaxiesrather than devouring anything that ventures too close to them the black holes at the centers of most galaxies only give away their existence through subtle effects on nearby stars 
in an active galaxy however the supermassive black hole behaves a lot differently 
when surrounded by a swirling accretion disk of rapidly rotating gas and dust matter is constantly spiralling down into the black hole 
in the process it releases enormous amounts of energy sometimes even outshining the rest of the galaxy 
in the event horizon telescope succeeded in photographing one such galaxy messier producing a direct image of the accretion disc 
the ominous shadow of the galaxy s billion solar mass black hole is clearly visible quite literally as a black hole at the center of the supermassive black holes are formedmovies often portray black holes as giant cosmic vacuum cleaners relentlessly sucking in other material until there s nothing left 
if that was how real black holes worked there d be no mystery as to where the supermassive kind came from once an ordinary black hole had formed from stellar collapse it would simply grow and grow until it reached enormous size 
but real black holes don t suck matter in like this they merely attract it with the same law of gravity as a normal object of the same exceptional nature comes from the fact that they re and the force of gravity increases as distance decreases 
so it s possible for an orbiting object to stray into a region where gravity becomes incredibly strong 
at larger distances however a black hole s gravity is perfectly normal 
but if a black hole is incapable of sucking in distant matter how does it ever grow to supermassive size 
at present no one knows the answer to this although there are several promising what happens at the center of a black hole white holes what we know about black holes neglected where do black holes lead to black dwarf stars the theoretical end of stellar evolutionalthough they may not be the rapacious predators portrayed in we know that some black holes do absorb new material and that s what s going on in the accretion disks of active galaxies for example 
occasionally pairs of black holes crash into each other and merge to produce a single larger black hole and we know that from the evidence of gravitational waves which have been observed on a regular basis since they were first discovered in accretion and mergers while undoubtedly part of the solution aren t enough in themselves to explain the observational evidence for supermassive black holes 
that s because we know the first active galaxies which must have been powered by central black holes were formed very early in the life of the universe 
for example a supermassive black hole of a billion solar masses is believed to have existed in one galaxy more than billion years ago around of the way back to the big s possible that the stellar life cycle which is so crucial to the standard model of black hole formation had nothing to do with the creation of the oldest supermassive black holes 
instead they may have formed almost immediately from the gravitational collapse of an enormous cloud of gas one that already contained as much matter as millions of stars 
according to this theory a direct collapse black hole of this kind would have taken around million years to form the blink of an eye in cosmic hypothesis invokes the idea of primordial black holes which are theorised to have been created in the big bang itself 
these are sometimes proposed as a possible explanation for dark matter and are generally assumed to have been quite small in size 
however they might have served as the basic seeds from which supermassive black holes grew resources for more information about black holes check out death by black hole and other cosmic quandaries by neil degrasse tyson and gravitys fatal attraction black holes in the universe by mitchell begelman and martin rees

home news science astronomy neutron stars collided so are they a black hole now 
by harrison tasoff published october for the first time scientists have seen the source of gravitational waves from two colliding neutron stars and the space oddity doesnt stop there 
those neutron stars might have collapsed into a black hole after they merged scientists the observatories ligo short for the laser interferometer observatory and virgo detected a strong signal from the galaxy ngc 
scientists pinpointed the source of that signal in the sky and an international collaboration immediately sprung forth to observe the event with terrestrial and space observatories 
researchers detected light from the crash across the entire electromagnetic spectrum beginning with a burst of seconds after the gravitational waves were observations indicate that the waves and light came from a pair of merging neutron stars about million away according to a news conference on monday 
neutron stars are the incredibly dense remnants of stars that have exploded in supernovas 
the two that merged were and times as massive as our sun but each was no wider than washington according to a statement by the space telescope science institute 
when neutron stars collide 
what telescopes saw videos this still from a nasa animation shows the aftermath of a collision of two neutron stars which merged into an objected called 
gravitational waves from the collision were detected on 
image credit nasas goddard space flight lab as the stars spiraled into each other they sent gravitational waves through the universe and released tremendous amounts of light when they finally collided 
scientist call the phenomenon a dont actually know what happened to the objects at the end david shoemaker a senior research scientist at mit and a spokesman for the ligo scientific collaboration said at a news conference today at the national press club in washington we dont know whether its a black hole a neutron star or something neutron stars to black hole such a massive object could collapse under its own weight forming a black hole 
a black hole is essentially a point of infinite density surrounded by a region of no return the event horizon inside which not even light can the new object did collapse into a black hole its the lightest one that we know about harvard astronomer edo berger said at the news conference 
bergers team analyzed the light from the kilonova and found evidence of superheavy elements like gold and platinum forged in the violent event 
what neutron stars are made of infographic the kilonova associated with inset as observed by nasas hubble space telescope visible light and chandra observatory blue over nine days in august 
troja eleonora troja a astrophysicist at the university of maryland and nasas goddard space flight center expressed a bit more confidence in what the new object may be 
its very likely the collision of two neutron stars resulted in a new black hole she said at the news has good reason to believe the stars did form a black hole 
right after the and gravitational waves were detected on earth nasas swift burst observatory which orbits high above earth returned some interesting results a bright source of ultraviolet light but no 
this was the first time in the swift observatorys years of working on the mission that it had come up according to troja 
nasas chandra observatory and nuclear spectroscopic telescope array nustar also saw nothing in the signal 
but from what nine days after the gravitational waves were detected by ligo and virgo trojas team finally picked up a faint signal one so weak only the chandra observatory could detect troja the faint signal suggests the presence something far more powerful jets of matter and radiation spewing the same amount of energy in a few days that the sun radiates over millions of paltry signal was an effect of the viewing angle raffaella margutti an astrophysicist at northwestern university told 
it took nine days for the jet to spread out enough for the spray of to begin hitting earth she said 
margutti is the lead author on one of the chandra observatory studies that resulted from the discovery and a coauthor on at leat eight related swift telescope imaged the kilonova from two merging neutron stars in the galaxy ngc inset on just hours after gravitational waves and a burst from the event was detected 
image credit margutti cautioned that many astronomical objects can produce jets 
they simply need enough energy to feed a stream of material and an axis of rotation to establish the direction from which the material shoots nothing obvious that would tell us that the remnant was a black hole or neutron star margutti and radio observatories are still gathering data on the kilonova remnant but scientists may never know what became of the two stars 
once the light is off we will never see it again margutti harrison tasoff at htasoff or follow him harrisontasoff

home news science astronomy the event horizon telescope is trying to take the photo of a black hole by doris elin urrutia published april snapping a black holes silhouette is like photographing an orange on the moon 
astronomers orchestrated radio dish telescopes across the world into an virtual camera for a bold new experiment attempting to deliver the image of a black hole 
the telescope collaboration is set to make a big announcement of results this week and members also described their research approach at a talk in holes are extreme warps in that are so strong their massive gravity doesnt even let light escape once it gets close enough 
the astronomers idea is to photograph the circular opaque silhouette of a black hole cast on a bright background 
the shadows edge is the event horizon a black holes point of no return 
a picture is worth a thousand words and a photograph of a black hole would be an important tool for understanding astrophysics cosmology and the role of black holes in the universe 
related groundbreaking result coming from hunting event horizon telescopea still of a video simulation that shows what a black hole shadow might look like 
the animation was featured in a short movie about the event horizon telescope eht project produced by peter galison and chyld king

black holes are just as hard to spot said sheperd doeleman the project director of an ambitious new project called the event horizon shared this anecdote with an audience at a panel at the south by southwest sxsw festival in austin texas last month 
doeleman and fellow collaborators sera markoff peter galison and dimitrios psaltis illuminated how the project works during the sxsw event eht a planetary effort to photograph a black holes are massive structures when compared to planets and humans 
but what seems large to us is on a galactic scale 
so photographing a black holes event horizon artists impression depicts a rapidly spinning supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk 
this thin disk of rotating material consists of the leftovers of a star which was ripped apart by the tidal forces of the black hole 
shocks in the colliding debris as well as heat generated in accretion led to a burst of light resembling a supernova explosion 
bartmann one of the eht targets is about percent of the size of our solar system sera markoff an astrophysicist from the university of amsterdam said during the panel 
the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way called sagittarius a is about the size of the orbit of mercury doeleman added 
if a spaceship could zip astronomers out of the milky way which is about billion times bigger than sagittarius a according to markoff then spotting this black hole among the billions of other stars and planets in the galaxy would be quite tricky 
to observe the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way galaxy or to view another of the projects targets the supermassive black hole at the core of the supergiant elliptical galaxy messier the eht team had to turn earth into a virtual telescope platform 
thats because the power of a telescope to resolve images is limited to the size of its dish and by using an array of instruments across the world the team is effectively breaking up the dish and scattering the pieces globally to make one big space this huge black hole is spinning at half the speed of light the south pole telescope illuminated by the milky way and the aurora australis southern lights

image credit event horizon telescope was einstein right at the projects core its scientists want to answer two questions according to psaltis an astronomer and physicist at the university of arizona 
the first is simply if photographing a black hole is possible 
but the second important thing they ask is if einstein was percent right about how black holes behave 
einstein told us years ago exactly what the size and the shape of that black holes shadow should be 
if we could lay a ruler across that shadow wed be able to test einsteins theory of the black hole boundary doeleman said 
the team also wanted to build models that would describe black holes in various circumstances which will then be compared to eht infographic shows a simulation of the outflow bright red from a black hole and the accretion disk around it with simulated images of the three potential shapes of the event horizons shadow 
ozel in the work described at sxsw the team used graphics processing units gpus like the ones used in your favorite video game consoles or your computer to model all the hypothetical varieties of a black hole environment 
they produced hundreds of gigabytes of volume data to model the possibilities 
psaltis said photons plasma gas and magnetic fields are all described in a black holes forecast 
once they get one the team can compare an image of a black holes shadow to the different scenarios processed by the gpus in order to make the most realistic simulation of how a black hole behaves based on our current understanding of physics 
what the black hole image could do for us if we can get it would be to take something that is the most extreme the strangest prediction of general relativity one of the great accomplishments of the human mind and combine it with the most advanced electronics with a planetary scale collaboration with the most advanced statistics and new imaging techniques galison a professor at harvard university said during the panel

largest type of black hole the first direct image of a supermassive black hole located at the galactic core of messier 
it shows emission from a heated accretion ring orbiting the object at a mean separation of au or ten times larger than the orbit of neptune around the sun 
the dark center is the event horizon and its shadow 
the image was released in by the event horizon telescope collaboration 
a supermassive black hole smbh or sometimes sbh a is the largest type of black hole with its mass being on the order of hundreds of thousands or millions to billions of times the mass of the sun 
black holes are a class of astronomical objects that have undergone gravitational collapse leaving behind spheroidal regions of space from which nothing can escape not even light 
observational evidence indicates that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center 
for example the milky way has a supermassive black hole in its galactic center corresponding to the radio source sagittarius a 
accretion of interstellar gas onto supermassive black holes is the process responsible for powering active galactic nuclei agns and quasars 
two supermassive black holes have been directly imaged by the event horizon telescope the black hole in the giant elliptical galaxy messier and the black hole at the milky way s center 
description edit supermassive black holes are classically defined as black holes with a mass above solar masses some have masses of several billion 
supermassive black holes have physical properties that clearly distinguish them from classifications 
first the tidal forces in the vicinity of the event horizon are significantly weaker for supermassive black holes 
the tidal force on a body at a black holes event horizon is inversely proportional to the square of the black holes mass a person at the event horizon of a million black hole experiences about the same tidal force between their head and feet as a person on the surface of the earth 
unlike with stellar mass black holes one would not experience significant tidal force until very deep into the black holes event horizon 
it is somewhat counterintuitive to note that the average density of a smbh within its event horizon defined as the mass of the black hole divided by the volume of space within its schwarzschild radius can be less than the density of water 
this is because the schwarzschild radius r s s is directly proportional to its mass 
since the volume of a spherical object such as the event horizon of a black hole is directly proportional to the cube of the radius the density of a black hole is inversely proportional to the square of the mass and thus higher mass black holes have lower average density 
the schwarzschild radius of the event horizon of a nonrotating and uncharged supermassive black hole of around billion is comparable to the axis of the orbit of planet uranus which is au 
some astronomers refer to black holes of greater than billion as ultramassive black holes umbhs or ubhs but the term is not broadly used 
possible examples include the black holes at the centres of ton ngc eso and ngc which are among the most massive black holes known 
some studies have suggested that the maximum natural mass that a black hole can reach while being luminous accretors featuring an accretion disk is typically of the order of about billion 
history of research edit the story of how supermassive black holes were found began with the investigation by maarten schmidt of the radio source in 
initially this was thought to be a star but the spectrum proved puzzling 
it was determined to be hydrogen emission lines that had been red shifted indicating the object was moving away from the earth 
hubbles law showed that the object was located several billion away and thus must be emitting the energy equivalent of hundreds of galaxies 
the rate of light variations of the source dubbed a object or quasar suggested the emitting region had a diameter of one parsec or less 
four such sources had been identified by 
in fred hoyle and fowler proposed the existence of hydrogen burning supermassive stars sms as an explanation for the compact dimensions and high energy output of quasars 
these would have a mass of about 
however richard feynman noted stars above a certain critical mass are dynamically unstable and would collapse into a black hole at least if they were 
fowler then proposed that these supermassive stars would undergo a series of collapse and explosion oscillations thereby explaining the energy output pattern 
appenzeller and fricke built models of this behavior but found that the resulting star would still undergo collapse concluding that a sms can not escape collapse to a black hole by burning its hydrogen through the cno cycle 
edwin salpeter and yakov zeldovich made the proposal in that matter falling onto a massive compact object would explain the properties of quasars 
it would require a mass of around to match the output of these objects 
donald noted in that the infalling gas would form a flat disk that spirals into the central schwarzschild throat 
he noted that the relatively low output of nearby galactic cores implied these were old inactive quasars 
meanwhile in martin ryle and malcolm longair suggested that nearly all sources of radio emission could be explained by a model in which particles are ejected from galaxies at relativistic velocities meaning they are moving near the speed of light 
martin ryle malcolm longair and peter scheuer then proposed in that the compact central nucleus could be the original energy source for these relativistic jets 
arthur wolfe and geoffrey burbidge noted in that the large velocity dispersion of the stars in the nuclear region of elliptical galaxies could only be explained by a large mass concentration at the nucleus larger than could be explained by ordinary stars 
they showed that the behavior could be explained by a massive black hole with up to or a large number of smaller black holes with masses below 
dynamical evidence for a massive dark object was found at the core of the active elliptical galaxy messier in initially estimated at 
discovery of similar behavior in other galaxies soon followed including the andromeda galaxy in and the sombrero galaxy in 
donald and martin rees hypothesized in that the center of the milky way galaxy would contain a massive black hole 
sagittarius a was discovered and named on february and by astronomers bruce balick and robert brown using the green bank interferometer of the national radio astronomy observatory 
they discovered a radio source that emits synchrotron radiation it was found to be dense and immobile because of its gravitation 
this was therefore the first indication that a supermassive black hole exists in the center of the milky way 
the hubble space telescope launched in provided the resolution needed to perform more refined observations of galactic nuclei 
in the faint object spectrograph on the hubble was used to observe messier finding that ionized gas was orbiting the central part of the nucleus at a velocity of 
the data indicated a concentrated mass of lay within a span providing strong evidence of a supermassive black hole 
using the very long baseline array to observe messier miyoshi et al 
were able to demonstrate that the emission from an maser in this galaxy came from a gaseous disk in the nucleus that orbited a concentrated mass of which was constrained to a radius of parsecs 
their research noted that a swarm of solar mass black holes within a radius this small would not survive for long without undergoing collisions making a supermassive black hole the sole viable candidate 
accompanying this observation which provided the first confirmation of supermassive black holes was the discovery of the highly broadened ionised iron kα emission line kev from the galaxy 
the broadening was due to the gravitational redshift of the light as it escaped from just to schwarzschild radii from the black hole 
on april the event horizon telescope collaboration released the first image of a black hole in the center of the galaxy messier 
in march astronomers suggested that additional subrings should form the photon ring proposing a way of better detecting these signatures in the first black hole image 
formation edit an artists conception of a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk and emitting a relativistic jet 
the origin of supermassive black holes remains an active field of research 
astrophysicists agree that black holes can grow by accretion of matter and by merging with other black holes 
there are several hypotheses for the formation mechanisms and initial masses of the progenitors or seeds of supermassive black holes 
independently of the specific formation channel for the black hole seed given sufficient mass nearby it could accrete to become an black hole and possibly a smbh if the accretion rate persists 
distant and early supermassive black holes such as and ulas are hard to explain so soon after the big bang 
some postulate they might come from direct collapse of dark matter with 
a small minority of sources argue that they may be evidence that the universe is the result of a big bounce instead of a big bang with these supermassive black holes being formed before the big bounce 
first stars edit this section needs to be updated 
please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information 
november main articles population iii star and dark star dark matter the early progenitor seeds may be black holes of tens or perhaps hundreds of that are left behind by the explosions of massive stars and grow by accretion of matter 
another model involves a dense stellar cluster undergoing core collapse as the negative heat capacity of the system drives the velocity dispersion in the core to relativistic speeds 
before the first stars large gas clouds could collapse into a which would in turn collapse into a black hole of around 
these stars may have also been formed by dark matter halos drawing in enormous amounts of gas by gravity which would then produce supermassive stars with tens of thousands of 
the becomes unstable to radial perturbations because of pair production in its core and could collapse directly into a black hole without a supernova explosion which would eject most of its mass preventing the black hole from growing as fast 
a more recent theory proposes that smbh seeds were formed in the very early universe each from the collapse of a supermassive star with mass of around 
and primordial black holes edit large clouds of gas when irradiated by a sufficiently intense flux of photons can avoid cooling and fragmenting thus collapsing as a single object due to 
the core of the collapsing object reaches extremely large values of the matter density of the order of about and triggers a general relativistic instability 
thus the object collapses directly into a black hole without passing from the intermediate phase of a star or of a 
these objects have a typical mass of about and are named direct collapse black holes 
a computer simulation showed that the first supermassive black holes can arise in rare turbulent clumps of gas called primordial halos that were fed by unusually strong streams of cold gas 
the key simulation result was that cold flows suppressed star formation in the turbulent halo until the halo s gravity was finally able to overcome the turbulence and formed two black holes of and 
the birth of the first smbhs can therefore be a result of standard cosmological structure formation contrary to what had been thought for almost two decades 
artists impression of the huge outflow ejected from the quasar sdss artists illustration of galaxy with jets from a supermassive black hole 
finally primordial black holes pbhs could have been produced directly from external pressure in the first moments after the big bang 
these black holes would then have more time than any of the above models to accrete allowing them sufficient time to reach supermassive sizes 
formation of black holes from the deaths of the first stars has been extensively studied and corroborated by observations 
the other models for black hole formation listed above are theoretical 
the formation of a supermassive black hole requires a relatively small volume of highly dense matter having small angular momentum 
normally the process of accretion involves transporting a large initial endowment of angular momentum outwards and this appears to be the limiting factor in black hole growth 
this is a major component of the theory of accretion disks 
gas accretion is the most efficient and also the most conspicuous way in which black holes grow 
the majority of the mass growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur through episodes of rapid gas accretion which are observable as active galactic nuclei or quasars 
observations reveal that quasars were much more frequent when the universe was younger indicating that supermassive black holes formed and grew early 
a major constraining factor for theories of supermassive black hole formation is the observation of distant luminous quasars which indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of had already formed when the universe was less than one billion years old 
this suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the universe inside the first massive galaxies

maximum mass limit edit there is a natural upper limit to how large supermassive black holes can grow 
supermassive black holes in any quasar or active galactic nucleus agn appear to have a theoretical upper limit of physically around billion for typical parameters as anything above this slows growth down to a crawl the slowdown tends to start around billion and causes the unstable accretion disk surrounding the black hole to coalesce into stars that orbit it 
a study concluded that the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit isco for smbh masses above this limit exceeds the radius making disc formation no longer possible 
a larger upper limit of around billion was represented as the absolute maximum mass limit for an accreting smbh in extreme cases for example its maximal prograde spin with a dimensionless spin parameter of a although the maximum limit for a black holes spin paramater is very slightly lower at a 
at masses just below the limit the disc luminosity of a field galaxy is likely to be below the eddington limit and not strong enough to trigger the feedback underlying the relation so smbhs close to the limit can evolve above this 
it was noted that however black holes close to this limit are likely to be rather even rarer as it would requires the accretion disc to be almost permanently prograde because the black hole grows and the effect of retrograde accretion is larger than the by prograde accretion due to its isco and therefore its lever arm 
this would in turn require the hole spin to be permanently correlated with a fixed direction of the potential controlling gas flow within the black holes host galaxy and thus would tend to produce a spin axis and hence agn jet direction which is similarly aligned with the galaxy 
however current observations do not support this correlation 
the chaotic accretion presumably has to involve multiple events essentially random in time and orientation if it is not controlled by a potential in this way 
this would lead the accretion statistically to due to retrograde events having larger lever arms than prograde and occurring almost as often 
there is also other interactions with large smbhs that trend to reduce their spin including particularly mergers with other black holes which can statistically decrease the spin 
every of these considerations suggested that smbhs usually cross the critical theoretical mass limit at modest values of their spin parameters so that in all but rare cases 
activity and galactic evolution edit main articles active galactic nucleus and galaxy formation and evolution gravitation from supermassive black holes in the center of many galaxies is thought to power active objects such as seyfert galaxies and quasars and the relationship between the mass of the central black hole and the mass of the host galaxy depends upon the galaxy type 
an empirical correlation between the size of supermassive black holes and the stellar velocity dispersion σ of a galaxy bulge is called the relation 
an agn is now considered to be a galactic core hosting a massive black hole that is accreting matter and displays a sufficiently strong luminosity 
the nuclear region of the milky way for example lacks sufficient luminosity to satisfy this condition 
the unified model of agn is the concept that the large range of observed properties of the agn taxonomy can be explained using just a small number of physical parameters 
for the initial model these values consisted of the angle of the accretion disks torus to the line of sight and the luminosity of the source 
agn can be divided into two main groups a radiative mode agn in which most of the output is in the form of electromagnetic radiation through an optically thick accretion disk and a jet mode in which relativistic jets emerge perpendicular to the disk 
the interaction of a pair of galaxies can lead to merger events 
dynamic friction on the hosted smbh objects causes them to sink toward the center of the merged mass eventually forming a pair with a separation of under a kiloparsec 
the interaction of this pair with surrounding stars and gas will then gradually bring the smbh together as a gravitationally bound binary system with a separation of ten parsecs or less 
once the pair draw as close as parsecs gravitational radiation will cause them to merge 
by the time this happens the resulting galaxy will have long since relaxed from the merger event with the initial starburst activity and agn having faded away 
the gravitational waves from this coalescence can give the resulting smbh a velocity boost of up to several thousand propelling it away from the galactic center and possibly even ejecting it from the galaxy 
hawking radiation edit main article hawking radiation hawking radiation is radiation that is predicted to be released by black holes due to quantum effects near the event horizon 
this radiation reduces the mass and energy of black holes causing them to shrink and ultimately vanish 
if black holes evaporate via hawking radiation a and uncharged stupendously large black hole with a mass of will evaporate in around years 
black holes formed during the predicted collapse of superclusters of galaxies in the far future with would evaporate over a timescale of up to years 
evidence edit doppler measurements edit simulation of a side view of a black hole with transparent toroidal ring of ionized matter according to a proposed model for sgr a 
this image shows the result of bending of light from behind the black hole and it also shows the asymmetry arising by the doppler effect from the extremely high orbital speed of the matter in the ring 
some of the best evidence for the presence of black holes is provided by the doppler effect whereby light from nearby orbiting matter is when receding and when advancing 
for matter very close to a black hole the orbital speed must be comparable with the speed of light so receding matter will appear very faint compared with advancing matter which means that systems with intrinsically symmetric discs and rings will acquire a highly asymmetric visual appearance 
this effect has been allowed for in modern images such as the example presented here based on a plausible model for the supermassive black hole in sgr a at the center of the milky way 
however the resolution provided by presently available telescope technology is still insufficient to confirm such predictions directly 
what already has been observed directly in many systems are the lower velocities of matter orbiting further out from what are presumed to be black holes 
direct doppler measures of water masers surrounding the nuclei of nearby galaxies have revealed a very fast keplerian motion only possible with a high concentration of matter in the center 
currently the only known objects that can pack enough matter in such a small space are black holes or things that will evolve into black holes within astrophysically short timescales 
for active galaxies farther away the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon 
the technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies 
in the milky way edit inferred orbits of stars around supermassive black hole candidate sagittarius a at the milky way galactic center evidence indicates that the milky way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center from the solar system in a region called sagittarius a because the star follows an elliptical orbit with a period of years and a pericenter closest distance of m or au from the center of the central object 
from the motion of star the objects mass can be estimated as million or about kg 
the radius of the central object must be less than because otherwise would collide with it 
observations of the star indicate that the radius is no more than about the diameter of uranus orbit 
no known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain million in this volume of space 
infrared observations of bright flare activity near sagittarius a show orbital motion of plasma with a period of min at a separation of six to ten times the gravitational radius of the candidate smbh 
this emission is consistent with a circularized orbit of a polarized hot spot on an accretion disk in a strong magnetic field 
the radiating matter is orbiting at of the speed of light just outside the innermost stable circular orbit 
on january nasa reported observing an flare times brighter than usual a from sagittarius a 
the unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into sagittarius a according to astronomers 
detection of an unusually bright flare from sagittarius a a supermassive black hole in the center of the milky way galaxy 
sagittarius a imaged by the event horizon telescope 
outside the milky way edit artists impression of a supermassive black hole tearing apart a star 
below supermassive black hole devouring a star in galaxy rx left and optical right 
unambiguous dynamical evidence for supermassive black holes exists only in a handful of galaxies these include the milky way the local group galaxies and and a few galaxies beyond the local group such as ngc 
in these galaxies the root mean square or rms velocities of the stars or gas rises proportionally to near the center indicating a central point mass 
in all other galaxies observed to date the rms velocities are flat or even falling toward the center making it impossible to state with certainty that a supermassive black hole is present 
nevertheless it is commonly accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole 
the reason for this assumption is the relation a tight low scatter relation between the mass of the hole in the or so galaxies with secure detections and the velocity dispersion of the stars in the bulges of those galaxies 
this correlation although based on just a handful of galaxies suggests to many astronomers a strong connection between the formation of the black hole and the galaxy itself 
on march a supermassive black hole was seen tearing a star apart 
that is the only likely explanation of the observations that day of sudden radiation and the observations 
the source was previously an inactive galactic nucleus and from study of the outburst the galactic nucleus is estimated to be a smbh with mass of the order of a million 
this rare event is assumed to be a relativistic outflow material being emitted in a jet at a significant fraction of the speed of light from a star tidally disrupted by the smbh 
a significant fraction of a solar mass of material is expected to have accreted onto the smbh 
subsequent observation will allow this assumption to be confirmed if the emission from the jet decays at the expected rate for mass accretion onto a smbh 
individual studies edit hubble space telescope photograph of the relativistic jet of messier which is matter being ejected by the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy the nearby andromeda galaxy million away contains a million central black hole significantly larger than the milky ways 
the largest supermassive black hole in the milky ways vicinity appears to be that of messier at a mass of billion at a distance of million 
the supergiant elliptical galaxy ngc at a distance of million away in the coma berenices constellation contains a black hole measured to be billion 
masses of black holes in quasars can be estimated via indirect methods that are subject to substantial uncertainty 
the quasar ton is an example of an object with an extremely large black hole estimated at billion 
other examples of quasars with large estimated black hole masses are the hyperluminous quasar apm with an estimated mass of billion and the quasar smss with a mass of billion or nearly times the mass of the black hole at the milky ways galactic center 
some galaxies such as the galaxy appear to have two supermassive black holes at their centers forming a binary system 
if they collided the event would create strong gravitational waves 
binary supermassive black holes are believed to be a common consequence of galactic mergers 
the binary pair in oj billion away contains the most massive black hole in a pair with a mass estimated at billion 
in a black hole was discovered in the dwarf galaxy henize which has no bulge 
the precise implications for this discovery on black hole formation are unknown but may indicate that black holes formed before bulges 
a gas cloud with several times the mass of the earth is accelerating towards a supermassive black hole at the centre of the milky way 
in astronomers reported an unusually large mass of approximately billion for the black hole in the compact lenticular galaxy ngc which lies million away in the constellation perseus 
the putative black hole has approximately percent of the mass of the bulge of this lenticular galaxy percent of the total stellar mass of the galaxy 
another study reached a very different conclusion this black hole is not particularly overmassive estimated at between and billion with billion being the most likely value 
on february astronomers reported on the use of the nustar satellite to accurately measure the spin of a supermassive black hole for the first time in ngc reporting that the event horizon was spinning at almost the speed of light 
in september data from different telescopes have shown that the extremely small dense ultracompact dwarf galaxy hosts a million solar mass black hole at its center accounting for more than of the total mass of the galaxy 
the discovery is quite surprising since the black hole is five times more massive than the milky ways black hole despite the galaxy being less than the mass of the milky way 
some galaxies lack any supermassive black holes in their centers 
although most galaxies with no supermassive black holes are very small dwarf galaxies one discovery remains mysterious the supergiant elliptical cd galaxy has not been found to contain an active supermassive black hole of at least despite the galaxy being one of the largest galaxies known over six times the size and one thousand times the mass of the milky way 
despite that several studies gave very large mass values for a possible central black hole inside such as about as large as or as low as 
since a supermassive black hole will only be visible while it is accreting a supermassive black hole can be nearly invisible except in its effects on stellar orbits 
this implies that either has a central black hole that is accreting at a low level or has a mass rather below 
in december astronomers reported the detection of the most distant quasar known by this time ulas containing the most distant supermassive black hole at a reported redshift of z surpassing the redshift of for the previously known most distant quasar ulas

it occurred in the ophiuchus cluster in the galaxy neve caused by the accretion of nearly million of material by its central supermassive black hole 
the eruption lasted for about million years and released million times more energy than the most powerful burst known

black hole at the dawn of time challenges our understanding of how the universe was formed 
it had reached its size just million years after the point beyond which there is nothing 
the most dominant scientific theory of recent years describes that point as the big spontaneous eruption of reality as we know it out of a quantum singularity 
but another idea has recently been gaining weight that the universe goes through periodic expansions and in a big bounce 
and the existence of early black holes has been predicted to be a key telltale as to whether or not the idea may be valid 
this one is very big 
to get to its million times more mass than our must have swallowed a lot of stuff 
as far as we understand it the universe simply wasnt old enough at that time to generate such a monster

here s how it works 
home news entertainment the science of interstellar black holes wormholes and space travel by mike wall published november a theatrical poster for the film interstellar shows the spaceship endurance flying through a wormhole 
image credit paramount pictures the epic interstellar is just a movie but it throws a lot of science on the screen for space geeks to sink their teeth which opened in theaters across the united states on friday delves into black holes and wormholes and it touches down on more than one alien planet 
the film apparently takes its science seriously renowned theoretical physicist kip thorne served as an adviser and executive producer on a look at some of the concepts that play key roles in the film which was directed by christopher nolan and stars matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway jessica chastain and michael caine 
caution some spoilers ahead 
interstellar a space epic in pictures journey through a wormholewormhole travel across the universe and supergiant black holes are just some of the wonders seen in the film interstellar 
see how the science of interstellar works in this infographic 
image credit by karl tate infographics artist interstellar is set at some nebulous point in the future when global crop failures threaten humanity with extinction 
so a small band of explorers led by a named cooper mcconaughey blasts off to search for an exoplanet that could serve as a new home for the human astronauts are aided in their quest by a wormhole a sort of tunnel that allows relatively quick travel between widely separated parts of the universe which had mysteriously appeared near saturn some years before 
cooper steers the pioneers ship called endurance through the wormhole into a portion of a faraway wormholes are a favored trope nobody knows whether or not they actually exist 
according to einsteins theory of general relativity they are possible but no sign of them has ever been scientists say a wormhole would likely collapse quickly unless it was propped open using some kind of matter 
so the big wormhole in interstellar would require some serious and exotic engineering work but ill stop here so i dont give too much away about the interstellar team used equations provided by thorne to come up with their representation of the wormhole depicting its entrance as a shimmering sphere just as it likely would look in real life thorne wormholes nor black holes have been depicted in any hollywood movie in the way that they actually would appear thorne said recently in an interstellar science video produced by wired magazine 
this is the first time the depiction began with einsteins general relativity gorgeous black holemuch of the action in interstellar revolves around a giant black hole which cooper and his crewmates call gargantua 
thorne said he and the crew took a great deal of care to depict the monster result is an exotic object that twists its infalling disk of dust and gas into complex shapes with the overall effect further complicated by gravitational lensing a real astronomical phenomenon in which a massive foreground object such as a black hole warps the light emitted by stars and other bodies located much farther away 
images black holes of the universe the collaboration between thorne and the interstellar people was so successful that it will extend into the scientific literature the physicist going to write several technical papers about this one aimed at the astrophysics community and then something for the community saying here are some things weve discovered about gravitational lensing by rapidly spinning black holes that we never knew before thorne said in the wired few quibblesin the film interstellar astronauts use a variety of spacecraft to cross the universe and explore alien worlds 
see how they work in this infographic 
image credit by karl tate infographics artist in the movie however cooper and his crew spend some time in close proximity to the black hole which strains astronauts would likely be killed by the energetic radiation thrown off by the superhot disk of material circling gargantua roberto trotta an astrophysicist at imperial college london noted in an article for the british newspaper the guardian 
or theyd be spaghettified by the intense gravitional pull which would be much stronger at one end of their bodies than the other trotta thats not the only issue 
the astronauts land on a world that orbits very close to gargantua so close that as the film depicts it for every hour spent on the exoplanets surface seven years elapse on earth 
such time dilation does indeed occur in the presence of gravitational fields but theres no way it could be so extreme according to would need such a strong gravitational field that you need to be close to what is called the schwarzschild radius of the object essentially the event horizon of a black hole he wrote in the guardian 
the event horizon is the point beyond which nothing not even light can escape a black holes clutches 
there is simply no planet that can have this kind of gravity and if you tried to land on the surface it would be so strong it would crush you 
the numbers simply do not fact a planet so close to a black hole could not even exist trotta observed tidal forces generated by the black holes immense gravity would tear the planet visual spectaclesuch details will rankle some filmgoers while other folks wont mind suspending their disbelief 
but most people who see interstellar will probably agree that its a stunning visual of the alien planets depicted in the film for example is a water world featuring mysterious gigantic waves while another is a frigid realm whose clouds are frozen solid 
these worlds are gorgeously rendered as are the many spaceflight sequences throughout the spaceships in interstellar are also nicely conceived and designed 
endurance is a vehicle consisting of boxy modules some of which can be shuttled to the surface of an exoplanet to set up a base 
the mothership carries two landers to perform this work as well as two rangers which the crew uses for planetary endurance rotates times per minute to generate gravity aboard the ship a detail the sticklers in the audience will doubtless mike wall on twitter michaeldwall and

home news science astronomy what exactly is a black hole event horizon and what happens there 
by charles choi published april a visualization from a supercomputer simulation shows how positrons behave near the event horizon of a rotating black hole 
image credit kyle parfrey et lab on wednesday april the international event horizon telescope project will release the first results from its plan to image black holes 
but what exactly is an event horizon the event horizon of a black hole is linked to the objects escape velocity the speed that one would need to exceed to escape the black holes gravitational pull 
the closer someone came to a black hole the greater the speed they would need to escape that massive gravity 
the event horizon is the threshold around the black hole where the escape velocity surpasses the speed of light 
according to einsteins theory of special relativity nothing can travel faster through space than the speed of light 
this means a black holes event horizon is essentially the point from which nothing can return 
the name refers to the impossibility of witnessing any event taking place inside that border the horizon beyond which one can not groundbreaking result coming soon from event horizon telescope the event horizon is the ultimate prison wall one can get in but never get out avi loeb chair of astronomy at harvard university told an item gets near an event horizon a witness would see the items image redden and dim as gravity distorted light coming from that item 
at the event horizon this image would effectively fade to the event horizon one would find the black holes singularity where previous research suggests all of the objects mass has collapsed to an infinitely dense extent 
this means the fabric of space and time around the singularity has also curved to an infinite degree so the laws of physics as we currently know them break down 
the event horizon protects us from the unknown physics near a singularity loeb said 
related images black holes of the universe the size of an event horizon depends on the black holes mass 
if earth were compressed until it became a black hole it would have a diameter of about inches millimeters a little smaller than a dime if the sun were converted to a black hole it would be about miles kilometers wide about the size of a village or town 
the supermassive black holes that the event horizon telescope is observing are far larger sagittarius a at the center of the milky way is about million times the mass of our sun and has a diameter of about million miles million km while at the heart of the virgo a galaxy is about billion solar masses and billion miles billion km strength of a black holes gravitational pull depends on the distance from it the closer you are the more powerful the tug 
but the effects of this gravity on a visitor would differ depending on the black holes mass 
if you fell toward a relatively small black hole a few times the mass of the sun for example you would get pulled apart and stretched out in a process known as spaghettification dying well before you reached the event horizon 
however if you were to fall toward a supermassive black hole millions to billions of times the mass of the sun you wouldnt feel such forces to a significant degree loeb said 
you would not die of spaghettification before you crossed the event horizon although numerous other hazards around such a black hole might kill you before you reached that point holes likely spin because the stars they generally originate from also spun and because the matter they swallow whirled in spirals before it fell in 
recent findings suggest that black holes can rotate at speeds greater than percent that of light loeb black hole quiz how well do you know natures weirdest creations previously the most basic model of black holes assumed they did not spin and so their singularities were assumed to be points 
but because black holes generally rotate current models suggest their singularities are infinitely thin rings 
this leads the event horizons of rotating black holes also known as kerr black holes to appear oblong squashed at the poles and bulging at their rotating black holes event horizon separates into an outer horizon and an inner horizon 
the outer event horizon of such an object acts like a point of no return just like the event horizon of a nonrotating black hole 
the inner event horizon of a rotating black hole also known as the cauchy horizon is stranger 
past that threshold cause no longer necessarily precedes effect the past no longer necessarily determines the future and time travel may be possible 
in a nonrotating black hole also known as a schwarzschild black hole the inner and outer horizons coincide 
a spinning black hole also forces the fabric of around it to rotate with it a phenomenon known as frame dragging or the effect 
frame dragging is also seen around other massive bodies including dragging creates a cosmic whirlpool known as the ergosphere which occurs outside a rotating black holes outer event horizon 
any object within the ergosphere is forced to move in the same direction in which the black hole is spinning 
matter falling into the ergosphere can get enough speed to escape the black holes gravitational pull taking some of the black holes energy with it 
in this manner black holes can have powerful effects on their can also make black holes more effective at converting any matter that falls into them into energy 
a nonrotating black hole would convert about percent of an infalling objects mass into energy following einsteins famous equation e 
in contrast a rotating black hole could convert up to percent of an objects mass into energy scientists have determinedrelated the strangest black holes in the universethis has important implications for the environments around black holes loeb said 
the amount of energy from the supermassive black holes at the centers of virtually all large galaxies can significantly influence the evolution of those work has greatly upset the conventional view of black holes 
in physicists suggested that anything falling toward a black hole might encounter firewalls at or in the vicinity of the event horizon that would incinerate any matter falling in 
this is because when particles collide they can become invisibly connected through a link called entanglement and black holes could break such links releasing incredible amounts of other research seeking to unite general relativity which can explain the nature of gravity with quantum mechanics which can describe the behavior of all known particles suggests that firewalls may not exist because event horizons themselves may not exist 
some physicists suggest that instead of abysses from which nothing can return what we currently think of as black holes may actually be a range of objects that lack event horizons such as fuzzballs loeb imaging the edges of black holes the event horizon telescope can help scientists analyze the shapes and behaviors of event horizons 
we can use these images to constrain any theory on the structure of black holes loeb said 
indeed the fuzzball speculation where the event horizon is not a sharp boundary but is rather fuzzy could be tested with images from the event horizon to peer into a black hole for time with event horizon telescopethis huge black hole is spinning at half the speed of light baffling astronomy mysteriesfollow charles choi on twitter cqchoi

artists illustration of the tiny black hole candidate known as the unicorn tugging on its companion a red giant star 
image credit ohio state illustration by lauren fanfer astronomers have apparently found the closest known black hole to earth a weirdly tiny object dubbed the unicorn that lurks just from nickname has a double meaning 
not only does the black hole candidate reside in the constellation monoceros the unicorn its incredibly low mass about three times that of the sun makes it nearly one of a the system is so unique and so weird you know it definitely warranted the nickname of the unicorn discovery team leader tharindu jayasinghe an astronomy student at the ohio state university said in a new video the school made to explain the find 
related the strangest black holes in the universethe unicorn has a companion a bloated red giant star thats nearing the end of its life 
our sun will swell up as a red giant in about five billion years 
that companion has been observed by a variety of instruments over the years including the all sky automated survey and nasas transiting exoplanet survey and his colleagues analyzed that big dataset and noticed something interesting the red giants light shifts in intensity periodically suggesting that another object is tugging on the star and changing its team determined that the object doing the tugging is likely a black hole one harboring a mere three solar masses based on details of the stars velocity and the light distortion 
for perspective the supermassive black hole at the heart of our milky way galaxy packs about million solar masses 
just as the moons gravity distorts the earths oceans causing the seas to bulge toward and away from the moon producing high tides so does the black hole distort the star into a shape with one axis longer than the other study todd thompson chair of ohio states astronomy department said in a statement 
the simplest explanation is that its a black hole and in this case the simplest explanation is the most likely explanation likely though it may be is not set in stone the unicorn remains a black hole candidate at the moment 
very few such black holes are known because theyre incredibly hard to find 
black holes famously gobble up everything including light so astronomers have traditionally detected them by noticing the impact they have on their surroundings though we did recently get our first direct image of a black hole thanks to the event horizon telescope 
and the smaller the black hole the smaller the impact 
but efforts to find extremely black holes have increased significantly in recent years thompson said so we could soon learn much more about these mysterious think the field is pushing toward this to really map out how many how many and how many black holes there are because every time you find one it gives you a clue about which stars collapse which explode and which are in between he said in the statement 
jayasinghe and his team report the detection of the unicorn in a paper thats been accepted for publication in the journal monthly notices of the royal astronomical society

home news science astronomy scientists detect rare crash of two mismatched black holes for the first time ever by meghan bartels published april this is roughly equal to the ratio of filling in a regular oreo to that in a mega stuf oreo 
investigations of connections between oreos and black hole formation are ongoing 
comments colliding black holes arent always as evenly matched as scientists expected according to a cosmic chirp astronomers have puzzled over for a april gravitational wave detectors picked up a signal of ripples caused by colliding black holes which in and of itself has gone from groundbreaking to nearly mundane over the past five years 
but as scientists studied the detection more closely they realized that it didnt match the signals they have seen so of two evenly matched black holes the new detection seemed to be triggered by a lopsided merger in which one black hole was three or four times more massive than the other 
scientists affiliated with the laser interferometer observatory ligo announced the discovery april at an online meeting of the american physical an unlikely observation maya fishbach a doctoral candidate at the university of chicago who presented the new discovery said during her talk 
its an exceptional event because we just wouldnt have expected it based on those first binary black eureka 
scientists photograph a black hole for the time an artists depiction of mismatched black holes colliding 
image credit fischer pfeiffer buonanno max planck institute for gravitational physics simulating extreme spacetimes project scientists studied those mergers during ligos first two observing runs conducted between and 
each time no matter how big the collision the two black holes involved were about the same size 
then just weeks into ligos third observing run in the newly reported signal appeared and turned that trend on its we had detected several binary black hole mergers before but never one where the bigger black hole is nearly four times more massive than its companion frank ohme a ligo scientist at the max planck institute for gravitational physics in germany said in a statement 
it s clear we are just beginning to understand the diversity of black hole binaries out there and i am excited to decipher the universes secrets every day a little newly announced discovery involved objects about billion away fishbach said with one black hole about eight times the mass of our sun and the other about times the mass of our is roughly equal to the ratio of filling in a regular oreo to that in a mega stuf oreo christopher berry a scientist at northwestern university wrote in a blog post about the detection 
dont get too excited investigations of connections between oreos and black hole formation are ongoing he added 
the detection gives scientists a better understanding of how black holes pair up 
we are learning that systems of this kind exist and how rare they are giancarlo cella researcher at istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy and the data analysis coordinator for ligos european counterpart virgo said in a statement 
this will allow us to deduce how they third observing run which was cut short by the spreading coronavirus pandemic netted a treasure trove of more than detections fishbach said 
scientists are still analyzing those observations so other unbalanced mergers could be hiding in that data 
but even just the one asymmetric merger dramatically reshapes the range of black hole pairs scientists are now prepared to one event represents a big step forward in our understanding of the population fishbach new research is described in a paper posted on april by the ligo collaboration but not yet published or

see all comments comments comment from the forums torbjorn larsson an observation at high significance meaning the mass difference likely is real 
despite that they see a large i think spin which was easier than in equal mass mergers of the larger black hole they cant reject that it was a merger between pristine black holes 
else the hierarchical merger the larger black hole already being a merger result looks interesting 
a birth place in a dense cluster with some trinary star systems is a possibility 
the mass asymmetry meant odd overtones in the gravity wave spectra so they could test general relativity theory further than ever before it still works perfectly well 
reply rod i note this from the article the newly announced discovery involved objects about billion away fishbach said with one black hole about eight times the mass of our sun and the other about times the mass of our sun 
however another report indicates the distance is spread to billion ligo and virgo detectors catch first gravitational wave from binary black hole merger with unequal masses was observed by both ligo detectors and the virgo detector on of april early during the detectors third observation run 
analyses reveal that the merger happened at a distance of to billion from earth 
the new unequal mass system is a unique discovery since all binaries observed previously by the ligo and virgo detectors consisted of two roughly similar masses 
distance is important when determining masses etc

home news science astronomy something weird is happening to the black hole at the center of the milky way by meghan bartels last updated may an artists depiction of a black hole at the center of a galaxy 
image credit astronomers have been watching the black hole at the center of our galaxy for years and in may they saw something theyd never seen technically they arent watching the black hole itself which scientists call sagittarius a or sgr a 
instead theyre looking at the matter around that black hole 
when the milky ways black hole is more active than usual that event horizon becomes brighter as it heats up due to friction 
usually sgr a is pretty calm for a black hole but in may that changed according to new black hole is always variable but this was the brightest weve seen in the infrared so far tuan do an astronomer at the university of california los angeles and lead author of the new study said on twitter 
it was probably even brighter before we started observing that night related eureka 
scientists photograph a black hole for the timethat hypothesis is based on the fact that when the astronomers focused on the area on may they only saw relatively high brightness decreasing suggesting that the black hole had passed an unknown peak that was even brighter 
according to the new paper the recent flare brought sgr a to twice the brightness of the highest previous measurement to and his colleagues made the observations using the keck telescopes on the summit of mauna kea in hawaii 
that instrument can see the world in near infrared light which encompasses wavelengths a bit longer than those our eyes can a timelapse of images over hr from may from keckobservatory of the supermassive black hole sgr a 
the black hole is always variable but this was the brightest weve seen in the infrared so far 
it was probably even brighter before we started observing that night 
morethey think the flare may have been caused by the close passage of either a star called last year or a dusty object called in scientists hope more observations of sgr a will help them sort out what the massive black hole is doing 
those observations include measurements made overnight on and after a hiatus due to protests at mauna the strangest black holes in the universeother instruments including the spitzer and chandra space telescopes and instruments have pointed to sgr a on and off throughout the past few months although those data have yet to be analyzed 
a new russian space telescope that launched about a month ago also has turned its eye on the black hole despite still being in its calibration black hole is also the target of the event horizon telescope a collaboration that published the first image of a black hole in april 
the historic image was of the black hole at the heart of a galaxy called but the scientists are also working on processing data about sgr a original observations are described in a paper posted to the preprint server on that was recently accepted for publication in the astrophysical journal future of black hole photography whats next for the event horizon telescopeno escape dive into a black hole infographic why are black holes so weird email meghan bartels at mbartels or follow her meghanbartels

home news science astronomy the milky ways monster black hole has a cool gas halo literally by charles choi last updated may this artists impression shows a ring of cool interstellar gas around the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way sagittarius a 
image credit dagnello for the first time astronomers may have imaged the cool disk of gas surrounding the gigantic black hole at the heart of the milky way a new study research may improve knowledge about how black holes grow and influence their the hearts of most if not all galaxies are supermassive black holes millions to billions of times the mass of the sun 
these enormous structures can have profound effects on the galaxies they call home for example they can blast out jets of matter at nearly the speed of light that can travel across an entire galaxy likely shaping the galaxys the strangest black holes in the universe the location of the black hole at the center of the milky way sagittarius a 
image credit baganoff et at the center of our galaxy lies the supermassive black hole sagittarius a often abbreviated sgr a 
this giant is about million times the mass of the sun and about million miles million kilometers in sgr a swirls a ring of debris known as an accretion disk 
the gas within this disk experiences so much friction that it can reach million degrees fahrenheit million degrees celsius according to researchers on the new study 
previous research has detected near sgr a likely given off from this hot research suggests that sgr a was also surrounded by relatively cool gas with temperatures ranging from about minus degrees f to degrees f minus degrees c to degrees c 
however it remains uncertain how much cool gas surrounded sgr a we want to learn about what processes are important and not important for how a black hole gets fed we need to know the environment around the black hole well study lead author elena murchikova an astrophysicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey told 
but the contribution of cool gas on a black hole has never been murchikova and her colleagues suggest that they may have imaged the cool accretion disk around sgr a for the first time 
this should help improve our understanding of how accretion onto black holes works she used the atacama large array alma in chile to analyze the center of the milky way 
specifically they focused on wavelengths of light given off by hot ionized hydrogen gas that could make it all the way from the heart of the galaxy to earth with very little loss of these light signals along the image from alma shows cool hydrogen gas flowing around the milky way centers supermassive black hole sagittarius a 
the red portion of the gas is moving away from earth and the blue portion is moving toward earth 
the crosshairs show the location of the black hole 
image credit alma murchikova dagnello the researchers detected a disk of cool gas about times the diameter of sgr a and estimated it was about the mass of jupiter or about times the mass of earth 
future research should aim for images of the cool gas around black holes and how this gas interacts with hot gas around black holes murchikova said 
we want to find out as much of what is going on around a black hole as possible she scientists detailed their findings online june in the journal closer to solving mystery of weird glowing ring around milky ways black holemilky ways monster black hole belches big but why the future of black hole photography whats next for the event horizon telescopefollow charles choi on twitter cqchoi

home news entertainment interstellar visual effects team publishes black hole study by mike wall published february the supermassive black hole gargantua plays a major role in the blockbuster interstellar 
paramount image credit paramount pictures the special effects that power the blockbuster interstellar are helping researchers better understand supermassive black holes and other cosmic interstellar crew has published a scientific study describing the computer code that brought to life the wormhole and enormous black hole dubbed gargantua that played central roles in the study which came out today in the journal classical and quantum gravity details how the computer code called double negative gravitational renderer or dngr helped construct a scientifically accurate view of gargantua by mapping out how millions of light beams travel through the warped surrounding the black hole 
the science of interstellar explained infographic the interstellar team discovered early on that the traditional way to create an onscreen black hole produced an odd flickering as stars and other objects moved about 
so they tried something get rid of the flickering and produce realistically smooth pictures for the movie we changed our code in a manner that has never been done before study lead author oliver james chief scientist at special effects firm double negative said in a statement 
instead of tracing the paths of individual light rays using einstein s equations one per pixel we traced the distorted paths and shapes of light new approach to making images will be of great value to astrophysicists like me said kip thorne a renowned astrophysicist who served as an adviser and executive producer of the film 
we too need smooth thorne and their colleagues also used dngr to better understand how strange crinkly surfaces called caustics affect images of distant stars as seen by a camera or observer close to a black light beam emitted from any point on a caustic surface gets focused by the black hole into a bright cusp of light at a given point james of the caustics except one wrap around the sky many times when the camera is close to the black hole he added 
this is caused by the black hole s spin dragging space into a whirling motion around itself like the air in a whirling tornado and stretching the caustics around the black hole many can read the new paper for free which was released in november centers on a small band of explorers that sets out to find a new home for humanity whose existence on earth is threatened by global crop failures 
this crew led by a former farmer named cooper journeys to another galaxy via a wormhole that mysteriously appeared near saturn

how do black holes grow 
black holes grow in mass by capturing nearby material 
anything that enters the event horizon can not escape the black holes gravity 
so objects that do not keep a safe distance get swallowed 
despite their reputation black holes will not actually suck in objects from large distances 
a black hole can only capture objects that come very close to it 
theyre more like venus flytraps than cosmic vacuum cleaners 
for example imagine replacing the sun by a black hole of the same mass 
permanent darkness would fall on earth but the planets would continue to revolve around the black hole at the same distance and speed as they do now 
none of the planets would be sucked into the black hole 
our earth would be in danger only if it came within some miles of the black hole much less than the actual distance of earth from the sun a comforting million miles 
the diet of known black holes consists mostly of gas and dust which fill the otherwise empty space throughout the universe 
black holes can also consume material torn from nearby stars 
in fact the most massive black holes can swallow stars whole 
black holes can also grow by colliding and merging with other black holes 
this growth process is what can reveal the presence of a black hole 
as gas falls toward a black hole it is heated to high temperatures generating powerful radio waves and that can be studied by astronomers 
the following pages showcase the supermassive black holes in the centers of two distant galaxies that reveal their presence through their very powerful radio waves and cygnus a elliptical galaxy quasar gas that falls into a black hole settles into a accretion disk 
friction and magnetic fields in the disk cause the gas to heat and emit

rather it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area think of a star ten times more massive than the sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of new york city 
the result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing not even light can escape 
in recent years nasa instruments have painted a new picture of these strange objects that are to many the most fascinating objects in space 
intense flares thought to be caused by a black hole devouring a star 
video watch the video the idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape it has been around for centuries 
most famously black holes were predicted by einsteins theory of general relativity which showed that when a massive star dies it leaves behind a small dense remnant core 
if the cores mass is more than about three times the mass of the sun the equations showed the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole 
a video about black holes 
watch the video scientists cant directly observe black holes with telescopes that detect light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation 
we can however infer the presence of black holes and study them by detecting their effect on other matter nearby 
if a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter for example it will draw matter inward in a process known as accretion 
a similar process can occur if a normal star passes close to a black hole 
in this case the black hole can tear the star apart as it pulls it toward itself 
as the attracted matter accelerates and heats up it emits that radiate into space 
recent discoveries offer some tantalizing evidence that black holes have a dramatic influence on the neighborhoods around them emitting powerful gamma ray bursts devouring nearby stars and spurring the growth of new stars in some areas while stalling it in others 
one stars end is a black holes beginning most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion 
smaller stars become dense neutron stars which are not massive enough to trap light 
if the total mass of the star is large enough about three times the mass of the sun it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity 
however as the star collapses a strange thing occurs 
as the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the event horizon time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away 
when the surface reaches the event horizon time stands still and the star can collapse no more it is a frozen collapsing object 
astronomers have identified a candidate for the black hole 
video watch the video even bigger black holes can result from stellar collisions 
soon after its launch in december nasas swift telescope observed the powerful fleeting flashes of light known as gamma ray bursts 
chandra and nasas hubble space telescope later collected data from the events afterglow and together the observations led astronomers to conclude that the powerful explosions can result when a black hole and a neutron star collide producing another black hole 
babies and giants although the basic formation process is understood one perennial mystery in the science of black holes is that they appear to exist on two radically different size scales 
on the one end there are the countless black holes that are the remnants of massive stars 
peppered throughout the universe these stellar mass black holes are generally to times as massive as the sun 
astronomers spot them when another star draws near enough for some of the matter surrounding it to be snared by the black holes gravity churning out in the process 
most stellar black holes however are very difficult to detect 
judging from the number of stars large enough to produce such black holes however scientists estimate that there are as many as ten million to a billion such black holes in the milky way alone 
on the other end of the size spectrum are the giants known as supermassive black holes which are millions if not billions of times as massive as the sun 
astronomers believe that supermassive black holes lie at the center of virtually all large galaxies even our own milky way 
astronomers can detect them by watching for their effects on nearby stars and gas 
this chart shows the relative masses of cosmic objects 
read the full article historically astronomers have long believed that no black holes exist 
however recent evidence from chandra and hubble strengthens the case that black holes do exist 
one possible mechanism for the formation of supermassive black holes involves a chain reaction of collisions of stars in compact star clusters that results in the buildup of extremely massive stars which then collapse to form black holes 
the star clusters then sink to the center of the galaxy where the black holes merge to form a supermassive black hole

here s how it works 
home news science astronomy bizarre black holes explained q a with physicist kip thorne by clara moskowitz published august simulated view of a black hole in front of the large magellanic cloud 
image credit alain wikimedia commons black holes are so strange so counterintuitive its hard to believe they actually exist 
yet scientists say the evidence that black holes are real is almost the pioneering physicists whove shed light on these dark objects is kip thorne an emeritus professor at caltech and architect of some of the leading cosmological theories of how black holes warp space and time 
thorne describes some of the latest thinking on black holes in a paper published in the issue of the journal caught up with thorne about warped space the nature of singularities inside black holes and the search for a grand unified theory of in your paper you say black holes are objects made wholly and solely of 
how can that be 
arent they also made of mass kip thorne yes but mass is equivalent to energy according to einstein and mass or energy can take many different forms 
it can take the form of energy in a blowing wind it can take the form in this case of mass or energy that is tied up in the curvature of itself 
photos black holes of the universe when an object like a star becomes a black hole what happens to its mass thorne the matter of which a star is made the atoms of which a star is made are destroyed at the center of a black hole when the black hole is created 
the matter is gone but the mass in the sense of mass and energy being equivalent has gone into the warped of the black you also talk about collisions between two black holes 
is this something that we think happens often thorne it happens we think in our own galaxy about once every years 
were not sure of that number it could be every years or once every million years 
looking out through the entire observable universe its going to happen more like once a minute or once a what happens to when two black holes collide thorne each black hole spins on its axis like the earth spins 
that spin creates two vortexes of twisting space somewhat like vortexes in a bathtub or a whirlpool 
theres one vortex of twisting space that sticks out of the north pole of the black hole and one vortex that sticks out of the south pole 
thats one aspect of a black holes warped 
there are others but lets just talk about that two black holes orbit around each other and collide and merge those vortexes then start sweeping around and around the merged black holes 
they get deposited onto the surface what we call the horizon of the merged black holes so you now have four of these vortexes on the horizon 
and as the black hole turns these vortexes sweep back like the spiral arms of a galaxy or like water from a whirling sprinkler they reach outward and backwards and they become these gravitational is there any chance that black holes dont exist thorne we have very extensive observational evidence by now of black holes 
the central dark object at the middle of our galaxy has been studied in beautiful observations showing bright stars that travel around the central object in orbits rather like the orbit of a comet 
they swing in close to the object and then are thrown back object can be weighed and it seems to weigh between and million times what the sun weighs 
its not producing any light but it does produce in erratic ways over time bursts of radio waves 
this object is just like what we think a black hole should still from a computer animation shows a simulation of a giant space cloud falling into sagittarius a the supermassive black hole at the center of our own milky way galaxy in 
image added on july 
image credit european research media center so i think in the minds of astronomers now theres no doubt 
there certainly was doubt years ago 
but the observational data from electromagnetic observations have become so good so impressive that i dont think theres any doubt when people talk about black holes they talk about singularities at their centers 
is a singularity really a spot of infinite density and zero volume thorne thats one way to describe it but the singularity like the black hole itself we believe is quite rich in its structure 
shocking things we learned from stephen hawkings book as you near the singularity we expect that it stretches and squeezes you in a chaotic way that ultimately kills you and destroys the matter of which youre made 
and when you get right to the singularity itself the laws of physics as we know them break down and the laws of quantum gravity take hold 
since we dont understand those laws very well yet we cant say what the nature of the very core of the singularity to truly understand whats going on inside black holes are we going to need a grand unified theory thorne were going to need a definitive quantum theory of gravity which is part of a grand unified theory its the main missing have to have a combination of general relativity that describes the warping of space and time and quantum physics which describes the uncertainties in that warping and how they clara moskowitz on twitter claramoskowitz or spacedotcom

a black hole is a region of space packed with so much matter that its own gravity prevents anything from escaping even a ray of light 
although we can t see a black hole the material around it is visible 
material falling into a black hole forms a disk similar to a whirlpool in a bathtub drain 
matter swirling around a black hole heats up and emits radiation that can be detected 
around a stellar black hole this matter is composed of gas 
around a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy the swirling disk is made not only of gas but also of stars 
stellar black holes stellar black holes form when the center of a very massive dying star collapses in upon itself 
this collapse may also cause a supernova or an exploding star that blasts the outer parts of the star into space 
if the core remaining after the supernova is very massive gravity completely collapses the core into a black hole with infinite density 
black holes created by supernovas can be about five to times the mass of the sun 
only stars with very large masses can become black holes 
our sun for example is not massive enough to become a black hole 
five billion years from now when the sun runs out of the available nuclear fuel in its core it will end its life as a white dwarf 
hubble s ultraviolet instruments detect the particle winds coming off accretion disks from black holes 
as light from the disk moves through the winds some of it is absorbed by material in the wind 
disk winds turn on when a black hole is gobbling material nearly as fast as it can 
these eating binges usually happen in a matter of months unlike with supermassive black holes whose meals take much longer than the course of a human lifetime 
hubble s unique ultraviolet capabilities make it an ideal tool for understanding matter falling into a black hole 
supermassive black holes this illustration shows igr a binary system that likely contains a black hole 
the strong gravity of the black hole on the left is pulling gas away from a companion star right 
this forms a disk of hot gas around the black hole the particle wind is driven off this disk 
credit stellar black holes are miniscule in comparison to the beasts that astronomers think lie at the centers of most galaxies 
these black holes are supermassive millions to billions of times the mass of our sun 
prior to hubble astronomers did not have conclusive evidence that supermassive black holes existed in the universe 
thanks to hubble and other observatories we now know that supermassive black holes are intricately tied to the evolution of the galaxies in which they reside 
these black holes formed at the same time as their host galaxies 
they are thought to have grown from seeds from the earliest massive stars 
spectacular jets are powered by the gravitational energy of a supermassive black hole in the core of the elliptical galaxy hercules a 
the jets shoot through space for millions of trillions of miles 
credit nasa esa baum and odea rit perley and cotton and the hubble heritage team news release when astronomers first turned radio telescopes on the sky they tracked radio wave sources to some typical cosmic objects including the remains of supernovas distant galaxies and powerful areas of star birth 
one particular type of object looked like nothing more than a point of light perhaps a star 
further observations showed that these objects were extremely far away meaning they could only be in very distant galaxies 
the objects called quasars were thought to be the incredibly bright centers of those faraway galaxies 
we now know quasars are the small but intensely luminous bidirectional beacons of light produced and powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies 
galactic material such as gas dust and even stars if located too close to a black hole will succumb to its relentless tug of gravity and be pulled inside 
as this happens the infalling material stretches heats and accelerates creating enormous forces near the event horizon the point of no return from the black hole s pull 
these forces produce powerful twisting magnetic fields that launch jets of material at near the speed of light and stretch thousands or even millions of across 
the intense forces create strong radiation across the spectrum from gamma rays to radio waves 
the distance to quasars is so great and their actual size so small about the size of our solar system that the mere fact that we can see them via telescope makes quasars the brightest objects we ve discovered in the universe 
in fact one of hubble s contributions to the quasar mystery was to prove with its high resolution there actually was a galaxy hidden behind the glare 
hubble observations also helped determine that these brilliant galactic centers are powered by supermassive black holes 
hubble found quasars in the centers of galaxies that are colliding or brushing up against one another as well as in elliptical galaxies which are thought to have developed as a result of multiple galactic mergers 
these interactions may help feed the supermassive black hole and light up the quasar 
how does hubble find black holes 
many of hubble s first observations showed the effects of supermassive black holes on their immediate galactic environment 
in shortly after launch hubble imaged a jet emanating from a galaxy known to be a prodigious emitter of radio light 
with hubble s observations astronomers had the data they needed to determine that these jets come from very small regions in the centers of galaxies and are likely powered by supermassive black holes 
hubble s fine resolution the ability to see tiny details helped propel the case for supermassive black holes even further in when astronomers took spectra of the gas in the center of the elliptical galaxy 
spectra or the breaking up of light into component colors can give astronomers a great deal of information about the gas including its velocity 
astronomers noted that in the central gas was circling in a disk at very high speeds around a small but massive object 
the only type of object that can be that massive and yet very small in size is a black hole 
these observations by hubble helped confirm nearly two centuries of theories and conjectures about the existence of black holes 
the space telescope imaging spectrograph stis an instrument installed on hubble in february is the space telescope s main black hole a spectrograph uses prisms or diffraction gratings to split the incoming light into its rainbow pattern 
each element interacts with light in a unique rainbow signature 
the position and strength of those signatures in a spectrum gives scientists valuable information such as how fast the stars and gas are moving 
stis can take a spectrum of many places at once across the center of a galaxy 
with that information the central mass that the stars are orbiting can be calculated 
the faster the stars go the more massive the central object must be 
a supermassive black hole creates a jet of particles traveling at nearly the speed of light from the center of galaxy 
a bright knot in the jet bursts forth from the disk of material swirling around the black hole 
credit nasa and the hubble heritage team news release how does a supermassive black hole affect its host galaxy 
from the wealth of hubble data astronomers now understand that black holes can have profound influences on the galaxy as a whole 
for example the jets from supermassive black holes can propel massive amounts of gas and dust into intergalactic space thus ridding the galaxy of fuel for ongoing star formation 
or in the case of a result using hubble observations of large elliptical galaxies jets from supermassive black holes may regulate star formation in such a way that it keeps going albeit at a slower rate 
perhaps the most surprising result from hubble s observations is that supermassive black holes must reside in the majority or even in all galaxies 
once the objects of extreme speculation supermassive black holes are now considered integral components of galaxies and crucial to the study of how galaxies evolve over time

here s how it works 
home references entertainment the singular pull of black holes in games by andreas inderwildi published february as mysterious as they are dangerous black holes in games allow us to reach the unreachable and teach us something along the way 
image credit dreamfeel black holes are fascinating 
no human being has ever been near one and it wasn t until that scientists even managed to take a snapshot of one 
and yet ever since they have first been hypothesized to exist black holes have exerted an inexorable pull on our collective imagination 
black holes are a reminder of the strangeness of our universe spots of infinite density and at the same time impenetrable emptiness 
since even light must bend to the gravity of a black hole we can not know what happens inside of it 
they are the points where the laws of nature as well as our limited human imagination break games love a good puzzle and so it s no big surprise that black holes have a habit of popping up here and there 
what may be surprising however is just how many forms and shapes they take 
as symbols of the unknowable and the extreme black holes are highly malleable and appear in all sorts of games playing many we cross the event horizon of this article be sure to check out our other gaming content 
if youre wanting to see the cosmos our guide to the best space exploration games has you covered 
weve also got our best vr space games guide for people seeking a truly immersive this article contains spoilers for the following games elite dangerous no man s sky outer wilds exo one genesis noir if found night in the woods dark souls iii the banner saga and portrayals of black holes image credit vladimir romanyuk the first and most obvious place to look are space simulators 
space engine universe sandbox and black hole simulator considered some of the best vr space experiences are intricate and educational toys that give us a chance to gawk at black holes up close to fiddle and prod and poke 
what happens if we swap our sun with a giant black hole 
or if we let two black holes collide 
but no matter how detailed the simulation or how many objects we send into oblivion we will always firmly remain on the outside looking holes and travel black holes and space travel exploring black holes image credit frontier developments plc 
games give themselves some more leeway when it comes to speculating about black holes 
in elite dangerous we undertake the long journey to one of the game s black holes with the most popular destination being sagittarius a the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy 
no man s sky and outer wilds actually let you enter black holes but they function merely as glorified shortcuts to other parts of the universe 
it makes you wonder where do black holes lead to 
image credit mobius digital while this approach arguably deprives black holes of some of their mystery outer wilds does draw on the hypothesized counterparts of black holes white holes that push instead of pull and expel everything that has fallen into a corresponding black hole 
in the game s fiction the ancient people called the nomai have figured out a way to travel through time and space using warp cores consisting of a hole the game we get to visit the place where the nomai created these cores black hole forge on the planet brittle hollow 
one of the most memorable locations in outer wilds brittle hollow is being devoured from the inside by the black hole at its center 
it s an sight and if you happen to fall inside the hole the white hole will spit you out in another corner of the solar system alongside the discarded fragments of brittle hollow 
the nomai s advanced technology is connected to the time loop that lies at the heart of the game it s technology powered by black holes that sends you back minutes into the past every time the sun goes supernova 
image credit exbleative in exo one we embark on a cosmic journey in a spacecraft 
the destination it turns out is a black hole that allows us to travel back in time preventing a catastrophe on jupiter that killed the main character s colleagues at the start of the game 
exo one s cosmos is a fantastical even mystical place 
its black hole isn t simply a anomaly but is intimately tied to the fate of our somewhat reminiscent of the black hole time travel premise in interstellar where crossing the event horizon of a black hole allows someone to interact with the past and change events 
with our current understanding of physics its almost certainly impossible but its a fascinating concept holes and mental health image credit feral cat den a black hole as a journey s enigmatic endpoint promising a chance to see and act beyond time genesis noir though a very different game from exo one follows a similar trajectory 
the game presents an allegorical and fantastical interpretation of the events leading up to the big bang and the creation of our universe 
presented in a jazzy film noir style the story follows the attempts of no man a metaphorical representation of time to save his love miss mass a metaphorical representation of you guessed it mass from a bullet shot by golden boy energy 
to do so no man seeks to create a black hole that would swallow the bullet 
but since the shooting of miss mass is also what causes the big bang saving her would also prevent the universe from coming into existence 
in the end no man has an epiphany that convinces him to drop his quest and make place for the noir is full of metaphors and its black hole can be read as a for urges and a negation of being itself 
even in this allegorical and abstract cosmogony the significance of the black hole is decidedly personal and tied up in psychological struggles 
image credit dreamfeel genesis noir is just one example of black holes acting as metaphors for personal crises 
if found presents its narrative of kasio a young irish trans woman s struggles to be accepted and find her place through an entwined dual narrative one is an exploration of a diary and the other a metaphorical story 
the story revolves around a lonely astronaut called cassiopeia and her discovery of a black hole which threatens to swallow soon becomes clear that the black hole expresses kasio s existential fears feelings of isolation and sense of futility 
the breakdown of inside a black hole is reframed as a personal psychological breakdown time doesn t exist in a black hole 
every moment crushed together past and present and future in one endless scream 
no way to change image credit infinite fall now night in the woods doesn t explicitly name black holes but its preoccupation with the night sky and metaphorical holes is very similar to if found 
here too our protagonist mae is threatened by black emptiness expressing mental health crises namely her feelings of emptiness dissociation and fragmentation 
the game speaks of the hole in the center of everything and her diary depicts mae being swallowed by a black holes symbols of cosmic crises black holes in myths and folklore image credit fromsoftware if black holes can be used as shorthand for personal crises it stands to reason that they can also be symbols of cosmic crises 
in dark souls iii the sun turns dark after a certain point in the game 
the ominous spectacle is never explained but recalls either an eclipse the darksign symbol of the dying light and the curse of the undead or a black hole 
the banner saga trilogy has a similar motif 
in the third game we learn about the existence of a subterranean dark sun and that it was its destruction which released a giant serpent as well as an darkness that spreads across the world 
image credit stoic studio even though these games do not strictly speaking show black holes there s more than a little family resemblance between them and they can easily be interpreted as black holes through the lens of myth and folklore with the likes of apocalyptic dragons or wolves swallowing the sun 
interestingly the symbol of the dark or black sun is a very old idea that predates our knowledge of black holes for many centuries 
it s part of the tradition of alchemical and hermetic thought signifying the dark material fire as opposed to the pure and bright fire of the spiritual light side of black holes image credit daniel stolcius de stolzenberg all of this sounds like a very serious matter 
but black holes can also be playful and even silly 
just look at the end event of fortnite s first chapter when the entire game world disappeared into a black hole and made the game unplayable for a few days or the black hole item in ultimate chicken horse which pulls on nearby objects and changes the trajectory of every grounded simulation there s a mystical and black hole 
for every black hole that throws light on a character s deepest struggles there s a playful or singularity 
it is precisely because of their inherent emptiness and silence their defiance of meaning and understanding and their definition through negation and apparent paradox that both exerts a powerful pull on our imagination and that enables black holes to play a vast range of very different parts 
as a cipher the black hole can stand for the inescapable for profound lack or distortion for the grand and unknown mysteries of the universe for fantastical possibilities and godlike power over itself and more 
and since video games remain the only way of getting close to a black hole they will continue being anything but a singularity in future outer wilds elite dangerous exo one no mans sky genesis noir on xbox game pass pc view deal at microsoft us ultimate view deal at microsoft us join our space forums to keep talking space on the latest missions night sky and more

how many black holes are there 
there are so many black holes in the universe that it is impossible to count them 
its like asking how many grains of sand are on the beach 
fortunately the universe is enormous and none of its known black holes are close enough to pose any danger to earth 
black holes form from the most massive stars when their lives end in supernova explosions 
the milky way galaxy contains some billion stars 
roughly one out of every thousand stars that form is massive enough to become a black hole 
therefore our galaxy must harbor some million black holes 
most of these are invisible to us and only about a dozen have been identified 
the nearest one is some lightyears from earth 
in the region of the universe visible from earth there are perhaps billion galaxies 
each one has about million black holes 
and somewhere out there a new black hole is born in a supernova every second 
supermassive black holes are a million to a billion times more massive than our sun and are found in the centers of galaxies 
most galaxies and maybe all of them harbor such a black hole 
so in our region of the universe there are some billion supermassive black holes 
the nearest one resides in the center of our milky way galaxy thousand lightyears away 
the most distant we know of lives in a quasar galaxy billions of lightyears away
